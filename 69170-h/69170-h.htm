so materially to the spread of Christianity, should be so little known among intelligent
Christians. The current information upon this remarkable sect or order of Judaism,
to be found in ecclesiastical histories and Cyclopædias, is derived from the short
notices of Philo, Pliny, Josephus, Solinus, Porphyry, Eusebius, and Epiphanius. These
seven witnesses—of whom the first and third are Jewish philosophers, the second, fourth
and fifth heathen writers, and the last two Christian church historians—are all who,
till within a very recent period, have been subpœnaed before the tribunal of public
opinion, to give evidence as to the character of these very much misunderstood and
neglected Essenes.
</p>
<p>Not only is this combined testimony insufficient, but it is too much tainted with
the peculiar dogmas of the respective witnesses, to furnish the general reader with
an unbiassed notion of the character and doctrines of this ancient sect. Philo and
Josephus, writing in Greek and in apology for their Jewish brethren, were too anxious
to represent to the Greeks and Romans every phase and sect of Judaism, as corresponding
to the different systems of Greek and Roman philosophy; Pliny, Solinus, and Porphyry,
again, betray too great an ignorance of the inward workings of the Jewish religion,
and too much prejudice against the Jews; whilst Epiphanius draws upon his imagination,
and Eusebius simply copies the account of Philo, with the well-known patristic pen.
Nor can the <span class="pageNum" id="pb6">[<a href="#pb6">6</a>]</span>modern descriptions of the Essenes, as given in the histories of the church and in
the popular Cyclopædias, be always relied upon when they profess to give the results
of the aforementioned garbled scraps of ancient information; since the writers are
either too much afraid of, or too much pleased with, the marked resemblance between
some of the doctrines and practices of Christianity and Essenism. Hence those who
style themselves the true evangelical Christians are very anxious to destroy every
appearance of affinity between Essenism and Christianity, lest it should be said that
the one gave rise to the other; whilst those who are termed Rationalists multiply
and magnify every feature of resemblance, in order to show that Christianity is nothing
but a development of Essenism—so that the poor Essenes are crucified between the two.
</p>
<p>The design of this essay is to give an impartial statement of the doctrines and practices
of the Essenes; to show their rise and progress, their relationship both to Judaism
and Christianity, their numbers and localities, to trace the most probable signification
of their name, &amp;c., &amp;c. To do this, I not only appeal to the seven stereotyped witnesses,
but to the information upon this subject scattered throughout the Midrashim and the
Talmud. But not to incur the charge of partiality, as well as to enable you to test
my conclusions, I have collected all that the ancients have written upon this subject,
and append to this paper the whole account which Philo, Pliny, Josephus, Solinus,
Porphyry, Eusebius, and Epiphanius give of the Essenes.
</p>
<p>The cardinal doctrines and practices of this sect are as follows:—They regarded the
inspired Law of God with the utmost veneration. In fact, their adhesion to it was
such that they were led thereby to pay the greatest homage to Moses, the lawgiver,
and to visit with capital punishment any one of the brotherhood who blasphemed his
name. The <span class="pageNum" id="pb7">[<a href="#pb7">7</a>]</span>highest aim of their life was to become the temples of the Holy Ghost, when they could
prophesy, perform miraculous cures, and, like Elias, be the forerunners of the Messiah.
This they regarded as the last stage of perfection, which could only be reached by
gradual growth in holiness, brought about through strictly observing the commandments
and the Levitical laws of purity contained in the Pentateuch, mortifying the flesh
and the lusts thereof, and being meek and lowly in spirit, inasmuch as this would
bring them into closer communion with him who is the Holy One of Israel. This earnest
desire to avoid everything which involved profanity in the slightest degree and which
might interpose between them and the Deity, made them abstain from using oaths, because
they regarded the invocation, in swearing, of heaven or the heavenly throne, or anything
which represents God’s glory, as a desecration. Their communication was yea, yea;
nay, nay; whatsoever was more than these came of evil.
</p>
<p>Their increased strictness in enforcing the observance of the rigid Mosaic Jaws of
Levitical purity, which were afterwards amplified and rendered still more rigid by
traditional explanations,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e202src" href="#xd31e202">1</a> ultimately compelled the Essenes to withdraw <span class="pageNum" id="pb8">[<a href="#pb8">8</a>]</span>themselves altogether from the society of their Jewish brethren, to form a separate
community, and to live apart from the world, since contact with any one who did not
practice these laws, or with anything belonging to such an one, rendered them impure.
This fear of coming in contact with that which is impure, as well as the desire not
to be hindered in their spiritual communion with their Creator, also made the Essenes
abstain from marriage; inasmuch as women, according to the law, are subject to perpetual
pollutions in menstruum and child-birth (compare Lev. xii, 1–8 ; xv, 19–31 ), and as going to one’s wife, even under ordinary circumstances, is regarded as defiling
(<i lang="la">vide infra</i>, <i>p.</i> 39, <i>note</i> 19). There were, however, some weak brethren who could not be like the angels in
heaven, neither marrying nor being given in marriage; these were allowed to take wives,
but they could never advance to the highest orders of the brotherhood, and had, moreover,
to observe laws specially enacted for married brethren and sisters.
</p>
<p>Here, in their separation from the Jewish nation, whatever any one of them possessed
was deposited in the general treasury, from which the wants of the whole community
alike were supplied by stewards appointed by the whole brotherhood; so that they had
all things in common. There were no distinctions amongst them, such as rich and poor,
masters and servants; they called no one master upon earth, but all ministered to
the wants of one another. They lived peaceably with all men, reprobated slavery and
war, and would not even manufacture any martial instruments whatever, however great
the temptation or the fear might be. They were governed by a president, who was elected
by the whole body, and who also acted as the judge of the community. Trials were conducted
by juries, composed, not as our juries are, of twelve persons, but of the majority
of the community, or of at least a hundred members, who had to be unanimous in their
verdict. <span class="pageNum" id="pb9">[<a href="#pb9">9</a>]</span>The brother who was found guilty of walking disorderly was excommunicated, yet was
he not regarded as an enemy, but was admonished as a brother, and received back after
due repentance.
</p>
<p>As it was contrary to the laws of Levitical purity to buy anything from one who did
not practice those laws, the Essenes had to raise the supplies of all their wants
among themselves. In this they experienced no difficulty, as their food and raiment
were most simple and very self-denying, and as each one of the community willingly
took his share of work in the department in which he most excelled. Some were engaged
in tilling the ground, some in tending flocks and rearing bees, some in preparing
food, some in making the articles of dress, some in healing the sick, and some in
instructing the young; whilst all of them devoted certain hours to studying the mysteries
of nature and revelation and of the celestial hierarchy. They always got up before
the sun rose, and never talked about any worldly matters till they had all assembled
together and, with their faces turned towards the sun, offered up their national hymn
of praise (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏המאיר לארץ‎</span>) for the renewal of the light of the day. This done, every one betook himself to
his work, according to the directions of the overseers, and remained at it till the
fifth hour (or eleven o’clock, a.m.), when the labour of the forenoon regularly terminated.
All of them again assembled together, had a baptism in cold water, put on their white
garments, the symbol of purity, and then made their way to the refectory, which they
entered with as much solemnity as if it were the temple. The meal was a common one;
and each member took his seat according to the order of age. Those of the brethren
who were the bakers and cooks then placed before each one a little loaf of bread and
a dish of the most simple food, consisting chiefly of vegetables as they ate very
little animal flesh, and the repast commenced after the priest had invoked God’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb10">[<a href="#pb10">10</a>]</span>blessing upon it. A mysterious silence was observed during the meal, which had the
character of a sacrament, and may have been designed as a substitute for the sacrifices
which they refused to offer in the temple. The priest concluded it by offering thanks
to the Bountiful Supplier of all our wants, which was the signal of dismissal. Hereupon
all withdrew, put off their white and sacred garments, and dressed themselves in their
working clothes, resumed their several employments which they had to do according
to the directions of the overseers till the evening, when they assembled again to
partake of a common meal. But though every thing was done under the directions of
the overseers, and the Essenes had even to receive their presents through the stewards,
yet in two things they were at perfect liberty to act as they pleased, viz., they
could relieve the distressed with as much money as they thought proper, and manifest
their compassion for those who were not of the brotherhood as much as they liked,
and whenever they liked. Such was their manner of life during the week days.
</p>
<p>The Sabbath they observed with the utmost rigour, and regarded even the removal of
a vessel as labour, and a desecration of this holy day. On this day they took special
care not to be guilty of forsaking the assembling of themselves together, as the manner
of some is. Ten persons constituted a complete and legal number for divine worship
in the synagogue, and in the presence of such an assembly an Essene would never spit,
nor would he at any time spit to his right hand. In the synagogue, as at meals, each
one took his seat according to age, in becoming attire. They had no ordained ministers,
whose exclusive right it was to conduct the service; any one that liked took up the
Bible and read it, whilst another, who had much experience in spiritual matters, expounded
what was read. The distinctive ordinances of the brotherhood, as well as the mysteries
connected with the Tetragrammaton <span class="pageNum" id="pb11">[<a href="#pb11">11</a>]</span>and the angelic worlds were the prominent topics of Sabbatic instruction. Every investigation
into the causes of the phenomena both of mind and matter was strictly forbidden, because
the study of logic and metaphysics was regarded as injurious to a devotional life.
</p>
<p>Celibacy being the rule of Essenism, the ranks of the brotherhood had to be filled
up by recruits from the Jewish community at large. They preferred taking children,
whom they educated most carefully and taught the practices of the order, believing
that of such the kingdom of heaven is best made up. Every grown-up candidate (<span class="trans" title="ho zēlōn"><span lang="grc" class="grek"><span class="corr" id="xd31e276" title="Source: ό">ὁ</span> ζηλῶν</span></span>) had to pass through a noviciate of two stages, which extended over three years,
before he could be finally admitted into the order. Upon entering the first stage,
which lasted twelve months, the novice (<span class="trans" title="neosystatos"><span lang="grc" class="grek">νεοσύστατος</span></span>) had to cast all his possessions into the common treasury. He then received a copy
of the regulations of the brotherhood (<span class="trans" title="diaitan tou tagmatos"><span lang="grc" class="grek">δίαιταν τοῦ τάγματος</span></span>), as well as <i>a spade</i> (<span class="trans" title="skalis haxinarion"><span lang="grc" class="grek">σκαλίς ἁξινάριον</span></span> = <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏יתד‎</span>), to bury the excrement, (comp. Deut. xxiii, 12–14 ,) <i>an apron</i> (<span class="trans" title="perizōma"><span lang="grc" class="grek"><span class="corr" id="xd31e325" title="Source: περίξωμα">περίζωμα</span></span></span> = <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זריז‎</span>), used at the lustrations, and <i>a white robe</i> (<span class="trans" title="leukēn esthēta"><span lang="grc" class="grek">λευκὴν ἐσθῆτα</span></span> = <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בגד לבן‎</span>) to put on at meals, being the symbols of purity. During the whole of this period
he was an outsider, and was not admitted to the common meals, yet he had to observe
some of the ascetic rules of the Society. If, at the close of this stage, the community
found that he had properly acquitted himself during the probationary year, the novice
was admitted into the second stage, which lasted two years, and was called <i>an approacher</i> (<span class="trans" title="prosiōn engion"><span lang="grc" class="grek">προσίων ἔγγιον</span></span>). During the period which lasted two years he was admitted to a closer fellowship
with the brotherhood, and shared in their lustral rites (<span class="trans" title="katharōterōn pros tōn hagneian hydatōn metalambanei"><span lang="grc" class="grek"><span class="corr" id="xd31e364" title="Source: καθαρώτέρων">καθαρωτέρων</span> πρὸς τῶν ἁγνείαν ὑδάτων μεταλαμβάνει</span></span>), but was still not admitted to the common meals (<span class="trans" title="eis tas symbiōseis"><span lang="grc" class="grek">εἰς τὰς συμβιώσεις</span></span>), nor to any office. If he passed satisfactorily through the second stage of probation,
<i>the approacher</i> became <i>an associate</i>, or a full member of the society (<span class="trans" title="homilētēs"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ὁμιλητὴς</span></span>, <span class="pageNum" id="pb12">[<a href="#pb12">12</a>]</span><span class="trans" title="hos eis ton homilon enkrinetai"><span lang="grc" class="grek"><span class="corr" id="xd31e400" title="Source: ὅς">ὃς</span> εἰς τὸν ὅμιλον ἐγκρίνεται</span></span> = <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חבר‎</span>), when he was received into the brotherhood and partook of the common meal (<span class="trans" title="symbiōtēs"><span lang="grc" class="grek">συμβιωτὴς</span></span>).
</p>
<p>Before, however, he was made a <i>homiletes</i>, or finally admitted into close fellowship, he had to bind himself by a most solemn
oath (this being the only occasion on which the Essenes used an oath) to observe three
things. 1. <i>Love to God.</i> 2. <i>Merciful justice towards all men</i>; especially to honor nobody as master, to avoid the wicked, to help the righteous,
to be faithful to every man, and especially to rulers (<span class="trans" title="tois kratousin"><span lang="grc" class="grek">τοῖς κρατοῦσιν</span></span>), for without God no one comes to be ruler. And 3. <i>Purity of character</i>, which implied humility, love of truth, hatred of falsehood, strict <span class="corr" id="xd31e442" title="Source: secresy">secrecy</span> towards outsiders, so as not to divulge the secret doctrines (<span class="trans" title="mystēria"><span lang="grc" class="grek">μυστήρια</span></span>) to any one, and perfect openness with the members of the order, and, finally, carefully
to preserve the books belonging to their sect (<span class="trans" title="ta tēs haireseōs autōn biblia"><span lang="grc" class="grek"><span class="corr" id="xd31e456" title="Source: τἀ">τὰ</span> τῆς αἱρέσεως αὐτῶν βιβλία</span></span>), and the names of the angels (<span class="trans" title="ta tōn angelōn onomata"><span lang="grc" class="grek">τὰ τῶν ἀγγέλων ὀνόματα</span></span>) or the mysteries connected with the <i>Tetragrammaton</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏שם המפורש‎</span>) and the other names of God and the angels, comprised in the theosophy (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מעשה מרכבה‎</span>) as well as with the cosmogony (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מעשה בראשית‎</span>) which also played so important a part among the Jewish mystics and the Kabbalists.
</p>
<p>The three sections consisting of candidate (<span class="trans" title="ho zēlōn"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ὁ ζηλῶν</span></span>), approacher (<span class="trans" title="perousiōn engion"><span lang="grc" class="grek"><span class="corr" id="xd31e501" title="Source: πἔροσιὼν">περουσιῶν</span> ἔγγιον</span></span>), and associate (<span class="trans" title="homilētēs, hos eis ton homilon enkrinetai"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ὁμιλητὴς, <span class="corr" id="xd31e516" title="Source: ὅς">ὃς</span> εἰς τὸν ὅμιλον ἐγκρίνεται</span></span>), were subdivided into four orders, distinguished from each other by superior holiness.
So marked and serious were these distinctions, that if one belonging to a higher degree
of purity touched one who belonged to a lower order, <i>i.e.</i>, if one of the fourth or highest order came in contact with one of the third or lower
order, or if one of the third touched one of the second order, or if one of the second
order touched one of the first or lowest order, he immediately became impure, and
could only regain his purity by lustrations. From the beginning of the noviciate to
the achievement of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb13">[<a href="#pb13">13</a>]</span>highest spiritual state, there were <i>eight</i> different stages which marked the gradual growth in holiness. Thus, after being accepted
as a novice and obtaining <i>the apron</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זריז‎</span>—<span class="trans" title="perizōma"><span lang="grc" class="grek"><span class="corr" id="xd31e543" title="Source: τερίζωμα">περίζωμα</span></span></span>) the symbol of purity, he attained (1) to the state of <i>outward</i> or <i>bodily</i> purity by baptisms (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏זריזות מביאה לידי נקיות‎</span>). From this state of bodily purity he progressed (2) to that stage which imposed
abstinence from connubial intercourse (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נקיות מביאה לידי פרישות‎</span>), or to that degree of holiness, which enabled him to practise celibacy. Having succeeded
in mortifying the flesh in this respect, he advanced (3) to the stage of <i>inward</i> or <i>spiritual</i> purity (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פרישות מביאה לידי טהרה‎</span>). From this stage again he advanced (4) to that which required the banishing of all
anger and malice, and the cultivation of a meek and lowly spirit (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏טהרה מביאה לידי ענוה‎</span>). This led him (5) to the culminating point of holiness (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ענוה מביאה לידי הסידות‎</span>). Upon this summit of holiness he became (6) the temple of the Holy Spirit, and could
prophesy (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חסידות מביה לידי רה״ק‎</span>). Thence again he advanced (7) to that stage in which he was enabled to perform miraculous
cures, and raise the dead (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏רוח הקדש לידי <span class="sic">תחה״מ</span>‎</span>). And finally, he attained (8) to the position of Elias the forerunner of the Messiah
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏<span class="sic">תחה״מ</span> לידי אליהו‎</span>).
</p>
<p>The earnestness and determination of these Essenes to advance to the highest state
of holiness were seen in their self-denying and godly life; and it may fairly be questioned
whether any religious system has ever produced such a community of saints. Their absolute
confidence in God and resignation to the dealings of Providence; their uniformly holy
and unselfish life; their unbounded love of virtue, and utter contempt for worldly
fame, riches or pleasure; their industry, temperance, modesty and simplicity of life;
their contentment of mind and cheerfulness of temper; their love of order, and abhorrence
of even the semblance of falsehood; their benevolence and philanthropy; their love
for the brethren, <span class="pageNum" id="pb14">[<a href="#pb14">14</a>]</span>and their following peace with all men; their hatred of slavery and war; their tender
regard for children, and reverence and anxious care for the aged; their attendance
on the sick, and readiness to relieve the distressed; their humility and magnanimity;
their firmness of character and power to subdue their passions; their heroic endurance
under the most agonizing sufferings for righteousness’ sake; and their cheerfully
looking forward to death, as releasing their immortal souls from the bonds of the
body to be for ever in a state of bliss with their Creator—have hardly found a parallel
in the history of mankind. No wonder that Jews, of different sects, Greeks and Romans,
Christian church historians, and heathen writers have been alike constrained to lavish
the most unqualified praise on this holy brotherhood. It seems that the Saviour of
the world, who illustrated simplicity and innocence of character by the little child
which he took up in his arms, also showed what is required for a holy life in the
Sermon on the Mount by a description of the Essenes. So remarkably does this brotherhood
exemplify the lessons which Christ propounds in Matth. chap v. , &amp;c.
</p>
<p>This leads us to consider the question about the origin of this brotherhood, and their
relationship to Judaism and Christianity. The assertion of Josephus that they “live
the same kind of life which among the Greeks has been ordered by Pythagoras” (<i lang="la">vide infra</i>, p. 226, § 4,) has led some writers to believe that Essenism is the offspring of
Pythagorism. The most able champion for this view is Zeller, the author of the celebrated
<i>History of Philosophy</i>. He maintains<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e604src" href="#xd31e604">2</a> “that Essenism, at least as we know it from Philo and Josephus, has, in its essence,
originated under Greek and especially under Pythagorean influences,” and tries to
support his conclusion by the following summary of the supposed resemblances between
Neo-Pythagorism and Essenism. (1) “Both strive to attain to superior holiness by an
ascetic life. <span class="pageNum" id="pb15">[<a href="#pb15">15</a>]</span>(2) Both repudiate animal sacrifices, the eating of animal food, wine and marriage.
(3) Both of them are, however, not quite agreed among themselves about the latter
point; for on both sides there are some who recommend marriage, but restrict connubial
intercourse to procreation. (4) Moreover, both demand simplicity of life. (5) Both
refrain from warm baths. (6) Both wear white garments, especially at dinner time.
(7) Both lay the greatest value upon their purification and eschew everything unclean.
(8) Both prohibit oaths, because a pious man does not require them. (9) Both find
their social ideal in institutions which it is true were only realized by the Essenes,
and in living together with perfect community of goods and unconditional subordination
of individuals to their overseers. (10) Both insist on strict secresy about their
schools. (11) Both like symbolic representations of their doctrines. (12) Both support
themselves on an allegorical interpretation of ancient traditions, whose authority
they recognise (13) Both worship higher powers in the elements, and pray to the rising
sun. (14) Both seek to keep everything unclean from their sight, and for this reason
have peculiar prescriptions about the discharge of the duties of nature. (15) Both
cultivate the belief in intermediate beings between the supreme Deity and the world.
(16) Both devote themselves to magic arts. (17) Both regard above all things the gift
of prophesy as the highest fruit of wisdom and piety, and both boast to possess this
gift in their most distinguished members. (18) Finally, Both corroborate their peculiar
mode of life with a dualistic view of the relation of the spirit and matter, good
and evil. (19) Both agree especially in their notions about the origin of the soul,
its relationship to the body, and about a future life, only the doctrine of transmigration
of souls seems not to have been known among the Essenes”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e611src" href="#xd31e611">3</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb16">[<a href="#pb16">16</a>]</span></p>
<p>Striking as these resemblances may appear, it will be seen on a closer examination
that some of the points which constitute this comparison do not exist in Essenism,
that others are either due to the coloring of Josephus or have their origin in Judaism,
that the difference between Pythagorism and Essenism are far more numerous and vital
than the parallels, and that Zeller’s conclusion is therefore not warranted. I shall
examine these points seriatim.
</p>
<p>(1) Asceticism is not foreign to Judaism. We meet with individuals who voluntarily
imposed upon themselves ascetic life to be able, as they thought, to give themselves
more entirely to the service of God by mortifying the lusts of the flesh, at a very
early period of Biblical history; and we need only to refer to the regulations about
Nazarites ( Numb. vi. 1–21 ), to the case of Manoah and his wife ( Judg. xiii .), to the life of Elijah ( 1 Kings xviii.–xix. ) to the practices of the Rechabites throughout the Scriptures, of persons abstaining
from the good things of this world, to see how the Essenes, without ( Jer. xxxv. 2 , &amp;c.), and to the numerous instances which occur copying the Pythagoreans or any
other heathen fraternity, would naturally conclude that asceticism is conducive to
a devotional life. (2) As to the repudiation of animal sacrifice, animal food, wine,
&amp;c, to which Zeller refers in the second point of comparison, I submit that the Essenes
<i>did not repudiate</i> animal sacrifices, but that they <i>could not</i> offer them on account of the different view which they had about holiness, as Josephus
most distinctly declares (<i lang="la">vide infra</i> <i>p.</i> 52), that neither Philo nor Josephus says a word about their objecting to eat animal
flesh or drink wine, and that their celibacy arose from an extension of a law contained
in the Pentateuch. Besides, it is not quite so certain that the Pythagoreans did not
offer animal sacrifices; Diogenes Laertius and others positively state that Pythagoras
himself sacrificed a hecatomb upon his discovering what is called the <span class="pageNum" id="pb17">[<a href="#pb17">17</a>]</span>Pythagoric theorem, <i>i.e.</i> that, in a right angled triangle, the square of the hypothenuse is equal to the sum
of the squares of the sides.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e645src" href="#xd31e645">4</a> (4) The fourth comparison about simplicity of life is involved in the first. (5)
The statement in the fifth comparison, that the Essenes refrain from warm baths, is
purely imaginary; (6, 7) whilst the white garments and the purifications mentioned
in the sixth and seventh parallels are strictly Jewish and Biblical. As symbolic of
purity the priests were required to clothe themselves in white linen ( Exod. xxviii. 39–42 ; Levit. vi. 10 ; xvi. 4 ), and the saints in heaven, washed and cleansed from all impurity, are to be clad
in white garments ( 4 Esdras ii. 39–45 ; Enoch lxi. 18 ; Rev. iii. 4 ; vi. 11 ; vii. 9, 14 ; xix. 8 ); soiled garments are regarded as emblematic of impurity ( Zech. iii. 3 , &amp;c.) Inseparably connected therewith are the frequent purifications or washings
enjoined on the priests before entering into the presence of God to perform religious
acts ( Levit. xvi. 4 ; 2 Chron. xxx. 19 ), and on the people generally after coming in contact with anything impure ( Levit. xi. 25, 40 ; xv. 5–24 ). The white garments and the frequent purifications of the Essenes, who strove to
live after the highest degree of Levitical purity, were therefore in perfect harmony
with exaggerated Judaism. (8) As to the assertion in comparison 8 that the Pythagoreans
prohibited oaths, it is well known that they did use oaths on important occasions,
and that they held it to be most sacred to swear by the number four, which they represented
by ten dots in the form of a triangle, so that each side consisted of four dots, as
follows:—
</p>
<p class="center xxl xd31e710"> • <br> •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <br> •&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;• <br>•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;•
<span class="pageNum" id="pb18">[<a href="#pb18">18</a>]</span></p>
<p>The community of goods, the secresy about their institutions, the symbolic representation
of their doctrines, &amp;c., mentioned in comparisons 9, 10, 11, 12, are the natural result
of their manner of life. (13) That they worshipped the sun is not borne out by fact,
(14) whilst their peculiar manner in performing the functions of nature is in accordance
with the injunction of Scripture ( Deut. xxiii. 13, 15 ), which the Essenes, as the spiritual host of the Lord, applied to themselves. (15)
As to their very peculiar belief in intermediate beings between the Deity and the
world, mentioned in the fifteenth point of comparison, I can only say that Philo and
Josephus say nothing about it. (16) Their devotedness to the study of the magic arts
was restricted to miraculous cures, and was not peculiar to them; since tradition
had made Solomon the author of books on magical cures and exorcisms, and Josephus
tells us (<i lang="la">vide infra</i>, <i>p.</i> 44, <i>note</i> 35) that he had seen other Jews performing these magic cures. (17) Neither is there
anything foreign in the opinion, that the power to foretel future events can only
be obtained by leading a life of preeminent holiness, for this was the common belief
of the Jews, though it is true that the Essenes were the only section of the Jewish
community who as a body strove to obtain the gift of prophecy. It, however, must not
be forgotten that others too laid claim to this gift. Josephus tells us that when
brought as prisoner of war before Vespasian, he addressed the Roman general as follows:—“Thou,
Vespasian thinkest that thou hast simply a prisoner of war in me, but I appear before
thee as a prophet of important future events. If I had not to deliver to thee a message
from God, I would have known what the Jewish law demands, and how a general ought
to die. Dost thou want to send me to Nero? For what? Will his successors, who ascend
the throne before thee, reign <span class="pageNum" id="pb19">[<a href="#pb19">19</a>]</span>long on it? No! thou, Vespasian, wilt be emperor and autocrat—thou, and this thy son.”
(<i>Jewish War</i>, iii. 8, § 9). This prophecy of Josephus is also recorded by the celebrated Roman
historian Dion Cassius who says: “Josephus, a Jew, was taken prisoner by him (i.e.
Vespasian), and put in chains; but he smilingly addressed him: ‘Thou puttest me now
in chains, but thou wilt loose them again, after twelve months, as emperor’ ” (<i>lib.</i> lxvi. <i>c.</i> 1); and by Tacitus (<i>lib.</i> v. <i>c.</i> 13). What Zeller says in comparisons 18 and 19 about their dualistic view of the
relationship of spirit and matter, good and evil, and their notions of the origin
of the soul, is entirely owing to Josephus’ colouring of the subject, as may be seen
from the notes on the extracts from this historian in the second part of this Essay.

<p>Having thus shown that the parallels between Pythagorism and Essenism are more imaginary
than real, and that the few things which might be considered as being <span class="corr" id="xd31e746" title="Source: analagous">analogous</span> are unimportant, and are such as will naturally develop themselves among any number
of enlightened men who devote themselves almost exclusively to a contemplative religious
life, I shall now point out some of the vital differences between the two brotherhoods.
1. The Pythagoreans were essentially polytheists; the Essenes were real monotheistic
Jews, worshippers of the Holy One of Israel. 2. The Pythagoreans clustered round Pythagoras
as the centre of their spiritual and intellectual life, and estimated the degree of
perfection of any of the members by the degree of intimacy which he enjoyed with Pythagoras:
the Essenes regarded the inspired Scriptures as their sole source of spiritual life,
and called no man master on earth, every one having the same right to teach, and being
alike eligible for all the offices in the commonwealth. 3. The Pythagoreans favored
matrimony, and we are told that Pythagoras himself had a wife and children; whilst
celibacy was the rule of <span class="pageNum" id="pb20">[<a href="#pb20">20</a>]</span>Essenism, marriage being the exception. 4. The Pythagoreans believed in the doctrine
of metempsychosis, which led them to abstain from eating animal flesh, because human
souls migrated into animals, and made Pythagoras once intercede in behalf of a dog
that was being beaten, because he recognised in its cries the voice of a departed
friend: the Essenes believed no such thing. 5. Scientific studies, such as mathematics,
astronomy, music, &amp;c, formed an essential part of the Pythagorean system: Essenism
strictly forbade these studies as injurious to a devotional life. 6. Pythagorism was
occupied with instigating the problems of the origin and constitution of the universe:
Essenism regarded such inquiries as impious, and most implicitly looked upon God as
the creator of all things. 7. Pythagorism taught that man can control his fortune
and overrule his circumstances: Essenism maintained that fate governs all things,
and that nothing can befal man contrary to its determination and will. 8. Pythagorism
enjoined ointment to be used by its followers: the Essenes regarded it as defilement
9. The Pythagoreans had a sovereign contempt for all those who did not belong to their
ranks: the Essenes were most exemplary in their charity towards all men, and in their
unbounded kindness to those who were not of the brotherhood. 10. The Pythagoreans
were an aristocratical and exclusive club, and excited the jealousy and hatred not
only of the democratical party in Crotona, but also of a considerable number of the
opposite faction, so much so that it speedily led to their destruction: the Essenes
were meek and lowly in spirit, and were so much beloved by those who belonged to different
sects, that Pharisees and Sadducees, Greeks and Romans, Jews and Gentiles, joined
in lavishing the highest praise upon them.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e751src" href="#xd31e751">5</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb21">[<a href="#pb21">21</a>]</span></p>
<p>As to the relationship which Essenism bears to Judaism, the very fact that the Essenes,
like the other Jews, professed to he guided by the teachings of the Bible, and that
a rupture between them and the Jewish community at large is nowhere mentioned, but
that on the contrary they are always spoken of in the highest terms of commendation,
would of itself be sufficient to prove it. In doctrine, as well as in practice, the
Essenes and the Pharisees were nearly alike. Both had four classes of Levitical purity,
which were so marked that one who lived according to the higher degree of purity,
became impure by touching one who practised a lower degree, and could only regain
his purity by lustration. Both subjected every applicant for membership to a noviciate
of twelve months. Both gave their novices an apron in the first year of their probation.
Both refused to propound the mysteries of the cosmogony and cosmology to any one except
to members of the society. Both had stewards in every place where they resided to
supply the needy strangers of their order with articles of clothing and food. Both
regarded office as coming from God. Both looked upon their meal as a sacrament. Both
bathed before sitting down to the meal. Both wore a symbolic garment on the lower
part of the body whilst bathing. Amongst both the priest began and concluded the meal
with prayer. Both regarded ten persons as constituting a complete number for divine
worship, and held the assembly of such a number as sacred. Amongst both of them none
would spit to the right hand in the presence of such an assembly. Both washed after
performing the functions of nature. Both would not remove a vessel on the Sabbath.
And both abstained from using oaths, though it is true that the Essenes alone uniformly
observed it as a sacred principle. The differences between the Essenes and the Pharisees
are such as would naturally develope themselves in the course of time from the extreme
rigour with which the former sought to practise the Levitical laws of <span class="pageNum" id="pb22">[<a href="#pb22">22</a>]</span>purity. As contact with any one or with anything belonging to any one who did not
live according to the same degree of purity, rendered them impure according to the
strict application of their laws, the Essenes were in the first place obliged to withdraw
from intercourse with their other Jewish brethren, and form themselves into a separate
brotherhood. Accordingly the first difference between them and the others was that
they formed an isolated order. The second point of difference was on marriage. The
Pharisees regarded marriage as a most sacred institution, and laid it down as a rule
that every man is to take a wife at the age of eighteen (Comp. Aboth v. 21), whilst
the Essenes were celibates, which, as we have seen before, also arose from their anxiety
to avoid defilement. Hence the declaration in Aboth d. R. Nathan—“<i>there are eight kinds of Pharisees</i>; … <i>and those Pharisees who live in celibacy are Essenes</i>” (c. xxxvii.).<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e769src" href="#xd31e769">6</a> The third difference which existed between them and the Pharisees, and which was
also owing to the rigorous application of the Levitical laws of purity, was that they
did not frequent the temple and would not offer sacrifices. And fourthly, though they
firmly believed in the immortality of the soul, yet, unlike the Pharisees, they did
not believe in the resurrection of the body.
</p>
<p>The identity of many of the precepts and practices of <span class="pageNum" id="pb23">[<a href="#pb23">23</a>]</span>Essenism and Christianity is unquestionable. Essenism urged on its disciples to seek
first the kingdom of God and his righteousness: so Christ ( Matt. vi. 33 ; Luke xii. 31 ). The Essenes forbade the laying up of treasures upon earth: so Christ ( Matt. vi. 19–21 ). The Essenes demanded of those who wished to join them to sell all their possessions,
and to divide it among the poor brethren: so Christ ( Matt. xix. 21 ; Luke xii. 33 ). The Essenes had all things in common, and appointed one of the brethren as steward
to manage the common bag; so the primitive Christians ( Acts ii. 44, 45 ; iv. 32–34 ; John xii. 6 ; xiii. 29 ). Essenism put all its members on the same level, forbidding the exercise of authority
of one over the other, and enjoining mutual service; so Christ ( Matt. xx. 25–28 ; Mark ix. 35–37 ; x. 42–45 ). Essenism commanded its disciples to call no man master upon the earth; so Christ
( Matt. xxiii. 8–10 ). Essenism laid the greatest stress on being meek and lowly in spirit; so Christ
( Matt. v. 5 ; xi. 29 ). Christ commended the poor in spirit, those who hunger and thirst after righteousness,
the merciful, the pure in heart, and the peacemakers; so the Essenes. Christ combined
the healing of the body with that of the soul; so the Essenes. Like the Essenes, Christ
declared that the power to cast out evil spirits, to perform miraculous cures, &amp;c.,
should be possessed by his disciples as signs of their belief ( Mark xvi. 17 ; comp. also Matt. x. 8 ; Luke ix. 1, 2 ; x. 9 ). Like the Essenes, Christ commanded his disciples not to swear at all, but to say
yea, yea, and nay, nay. The manner in which Christ directed his disciples to go on
their journey ( Matt. x. 9, 10 ) is the same which the Essenes adopted when they started on a mission of mercy. The
Essenes, though repudiating offensive war, yet took weapons with them when they went
on a perilous journey; Christ enjoined his disciples to do the same thing ( Luke xxii. 36 ). Christ commended that elevated spiritual life, which enables <span class="pageNum" id="pb24">[<a href="#pb24">24</a>]</span>a man to abstain from marriage for the kingdom of heaven’s sake, and which cannot
be attained by all men save those to whom it is given ( Matt. xix. 10–12 ; comp. also 1 Cor. viii .); so the Essenes who, as a body, in waiting for the kingdom of heaven (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מלכות השמים‎</span>) abstained from connubial intercourse. The Essenes did not offer animal sacrifices,
but strove to present their bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable unto God,
which they regarded as a reasonable service; the Apostle Paul exhorts the Romans to
do the same. ( Rom. xii. 1 ). It was the great aim of the Essenes to live such a life of purity and holiness
as to be the temples of the Holy Spirit, and to be able to prophesy: the apostle Paul
urges the Corinthians to covet to prophesy ( 1 Cor. xiv. 1, 39 ). When Christ pronounced John <i>to be Elias</i> ( Matt. xi. 14 ), he declared that the Baptist had already attained to that spirit and power which
the Essenes strove to obtain in their highest stage of purity.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e894src" href="#xd31e894">7</a> It will therefore hardly be doubted that our Saviour himself belonged to this holy
brotherhood. This will especially be apparent when we remember that the whole Jewish
community, at the advent of Christ, was divided into three parties, the Pharisees,
the Sadducees and the Essenes, and that every Jew had to belong to one of these sects.
Jesus who, in all things, conformed to the Jewish law, and who was holy, harmless,
undefiled, and separate from sinners, would therefore naturally associate himself
with that order of Judaism which was most congenial to his holy nature. Moreover,
the fact that Christ, with the exception of once, was not heard of in public till
his thirtieth year, implying that he lived in seclusion with this fraternity, and
that though he frequently rebuked the Scribes, Pharisees and Sadducees, he never denounced
the Essenes, strongly confirms this conclusion. There can be no difficulty in admitting
that the <span class="pageNum" id="pb25">[<a href="#pb25">25</a>]</span>Saviour of the world, who taught us lessons from the sparrows in the air, and the
lilies in the field, and who made the whole realm of nature tributary to his teachings,
would commend divine truth wherever it existed. But whilst Christ propounded some
of the everlasting truths which were to be found less adulterated and practised more
conscientiously among the Essenes than among the rest of the people, he repudiated
their extremes. They were ascetics; he ate and drank the good things of God ( Matt<span class="corr" id="xd31e901" title="Not in source">.</span>, xi. 19 ). They considered themselves defiled by contact with any one who practised a lower
degree of holiness than their own; Christ associated with publicans and sinners, to
teach them the way to heaven. They sacrificed the lusts of their flesh to gain spiritual
happiness for themselves; Christ sacrificed himself for the salvation of others.
</p>
<p>It is now impossible to ascertain the precise date when this order of Judaism first
developed itself. According to Philo, Moses himself instituted this order; Josephus
contents himself with saying that they existed “ever since the ancient time of the
fathers;” whilst Pliny assures us that, without any one being born among them, the
Essenes, incredible to relate, <span class="corr" id="xd31e906" title="Not in source">“</span>have prolonged their existence for <i>thousands of ages</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e910src" href="#xd31e910">8</a> Bating, however, these assertions, which are quite in harmony with the well known
ancient custom of ascribing some pre-Adamite period to every religious or philosophical
system, it must already have become apparent, from the description of it, that the
very nature of the Essenes precludes the possibility of tracing its date. The fact
that the Essenes developed themselves gradually, and at first imperceptibly, through
intensifying the prevalent religious notions, renders it impossible to say with exactness
at what degree of intensity they are to be considered as detached from the general
body. <span class="pageNum" id="pb26">[<a href="#pb26">26</a>]</span>The first mention we have of their existence is in the days of Jonathan the Maccabæan,
<span class="asc">B.C.</span> 166. (<i>Joseph. Antiq.</i> xiii. 5, 8). We then hear of them again in the reign of Aristobulus I., <span class="asc">B.C.</span> 106, in connection with a prophecy about the death of Antigonus, uttered by Judas
an Essene, of which Josephus gives the following account. “Judas, an Essene, whose
predictions had up to this time never deceived, caused great astonishment on this
occasion. When he saw at that time Antigonus pass through the temple, he called out
to his disciples, of whom he had no small number—‘Oh! it would be better for me to
die now, since truth died before me, and one of my prophecies has proved false. Antigonus,
who ought to have died this day, is alive; Strato’s Tower, which is six hundred furlongs
distance from here, is fixed for his murder, and it is already the fourth hour of
the day [ten o’clock]; time condemns the prophecy as a falsehood.’ Having uttered
these words, the aged man sunk into a long, dejected, and sorrowing silence. Soon
after, the report came that Antigonus was murdered in the subterranean passage which,
like Cesarea on the sea side, was also called Strato’s Tower. It was this circumstance
that misled the prophet.” (<i>Jewish War</i>, i. 3, § 5; <i>Antiq.</i> xiii. 11, § 2). The third mention of their existence we find in the well known prophecy
of the Essene Manahem, uttered to Herod when a boy.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e928src" href="#xd31e928">9</a> Now these accounts most unquestionably show that the Essenes existed at least two
centuries before the Christian era, and that they at first lived amongst the Jewish
community at large. Their residence at Jerusalem is also evident from the fact that
there was a gate named after them (<span class="trans" title="Essēnōn pylē"><span lang="grc" class="grek">Ἐσσηνῶν πύλη</span></span> <i>Joseph</i>. <i>Jewish War</i>, v. 4, § 2). When they ultimately withdrew themselves from the rest of the Jewish
nation, the majority of them settled on the north-west shore of the Dead Sea, sufficiently
distant to escape its noxious exhalations, and the rest lived in scattered communities
<span class="pageNum" id="pb27">[<a href="#pb27">27</a>]</span>throughout Palestine and Syria. Both Philo and Josephus estimated them to be above
four thousand in number. This must have been exclusive of women and children. We hear
very little of them after this period (i.e. 40 <span class="asc">A.D.</span>); and there can hardly be any doubt that, owing to the great similarity which existed
between their precepts and practices and those of the primitive Christians, the Essenes
as a body must have embraced Christianity.
</p>
<p>Having ascertained the character of the Essenes, we shall be better prepared to investigate
the origin of their name, which has been the cause of so much controversy, and which
was not known even to Philo and Josephus. There is hardly an expression the etymology
of which has called forth such a diversity of opinion as this name has elicited. The
Greek and the Hebrew, the Syriac and the Chaldee, names of persons and names of places,
have successively been tortured to confess the secret connected with this appellation,
and there are no less, if not more, than <i>twenty different</i> explanations of it, which I shall give in chronological order. Philo tells us that
some derived it from the Greek homonym <span class="trans" title="hosiotēs"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ὁσιότης</span></span> <i>holiness</i>, because the Essenes were above all others worshippers of God; but he rejects it
as incorrect (<i lang="la">vide infra</i>, <i>p.</i> 32) without giving us another derivation. 2. Josephus does not expressly give any
derivation of it, but simply says, “the third sect who really seem to practise holiness
(<span class="trans" title="ho dē kai dokei semnotēta askein"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ὁ δὴ καὶ δοκεῖ σεμνότητα ἀσκεῖν</span></span>) are called Essenes.” (<i lang="la">Vide infra</i> <i>p.</i> 41). From the addition, however, “who really seem to practise holiness or piety,”
Frankel<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e983src" href="#xd31e983">10</a> argues that the word must mean <i>holiness</i> or <i>piety</i>, because it appears to justify the name, and hence concludes that Josephus most probably
took it to be the Hebrew <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חסידים‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צנועים‎</span>. Whilst Jost<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e997src" href="#xd31e997">11</a> is of opinion that Josephus derived it from the Chaldee <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חשא‎</span> <i>to be silent</i>, <i>to be mysterious</i>, <span class="pageNum" id="pb28">[<a href="#pb28">28</a>]</span>because <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חשן‎</span> <i>the high priest’s breast-plate</i>, for which the Septuagint has <span class="trans" title="logeion"><span lang="grc" class="grek">λογεῖον</span></span> or <span class="trans" title="logion"><span lang="grc" class="grek">λόγιον</span></span> is translated by him <span class="trans" title="essēn"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἐσσην</span></span>, or that he might have deduced this idea from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חשן‎</span> itself, and traced it to <span class="trans" title="logeion"><span lang="grc" class="grek">λογεῖον</span></span> or <span class="trans" title="logion"><span lang="grc" class="grek">λόγιον</span></span> as <i>endowed with the gift of prophecy</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1061src" href="#xd31e1061">12</a> In Aboth of R. Nathan<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1129src" href="#xd31e1129">13</a> it is written <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עשאני‎</span> from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עשה‎</span> <i>to do</i>, <i>to perform</i>, and accordingly denotes <i>the performers of the law</i>. 4. Epiphanius again calls them <span class="trans" title="Ossaioi"><span lang="grc" class="grek">Ὀσσαῖοι</span></span> and <span class="trans" title="Ossēnoi"><span lang="grc" class="grek">Ὀσσηνοι</span></span> and tells us that it etymologically signifies <span class="trans" title="stibaron genos"><span lang="grc" class="grek">στιβαρὸν γένος</span></span> <i>the stout</i> or <i>strong race</i>, evidently taking it for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חסין‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עזים‎</span>. 5. In another place Epiphanius affirms that the Essenes borrowed their name from
<i>Jesse</i> the father of David, or from <i>Jesus</i>, whose doctrines he ascribes to them; explaining the name Jesus to signify in Hebrew
<i>a physician</i>; and calls them <i>Jesseans</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1189src" href="#xd31e1189">14</a> In this he is followed by Petitus who makes them so related to David that they were
obliged to take the name of his father <i>Jesus</i> or <i>Jesse</i>;<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1197src" href="#xd31e1197">15</a> although Jesus does not signify physician but <i>God-help</i>. 6. Suidas (<i>Lex s. v.</i>) and Hilgenfeld (<i lang="de">Die jüdische Apokal.</i> <i>p.</i> 278), make it out to be the form <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חזין‎</span> = <span class="trans" title="theōrētikoi"><span lang="grc" class="grek">θεωρητικοί</span></span> <i>seers</i>, and the latter maintains that this name was given to them because they pretended
to see visions and to prophesy. 7. Josippon b. Gorion<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1226src" href="#xd31e1226">16</a> (<i>lib.</i> iv. <i>sects.</i> 6, 7, <i>p.p.</i> 274 <i>and</i> 278, <i>ed. Breithaupt</i>), and <span class="pageNum" id="pb29">[<a href="#pb29">29</a>]</span>Gale (<i>Court of the Gentiles</i>, <i>part</i> ii., <i>p.</i> 147), take it for the Hebrew <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חסידים‎</span> <i>the pious</i>, <i>the puritans</i>. 8. De Rossi<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1266src" href="#xd31e1266">17</a> (<i>Meor Enaim</i>, 82 <i>a</i>), Gfrörer (Philo, ii. <i>p.</i> 341), Herzfeld (<i lang="de">Geschichte d. V. Israel</i> ii. <i>p.</i> 397), and others, insist that it is the Aramaic <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אסיא‎</span> = <span class="trans" title="therapeutēs"><span lang="grc" class="grek"><span class="corr" id="xd31e1294" title="Source: δεραπευτής">θεραπευτής</span></span></span> <i>physician</i>, and that this name was given to them because of the spiritual or physical cures
they performed. Indeed, De Rossi and Herzfeld will have it that the sect <i>Baithusians</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ביתוסים‎</span> mentioned in the Talmud is nothing but a contraction of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בית אסי‎</span> <i>the school</i> or <i>sect of physicians</i>, just as <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בית הילל‎</span> stands for <i>the school of Hillel</i>. 9. Salmasius affirms that the Essenes derived their name from the town called <i>Essa</i>, situated beyond the Jordan, which is mentioned by Josephus (<i>Antiq.</i> xiii. 15, § 2), or from the place <i>Vadi Ossis</i>.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1330src" href="#xd31e1330">18</a> 10. Rappaport (<i>Erech Milln</i>, <i>p.</i> 41), says that it is the Greek <span class="trans" title="isos"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἰσος</span></span> <i>an associate</i>, <i>a fellow of the fraternity</i>. 11. Frankel (<i lang="de">Zeitschrift</i>, 1846, <i>p.</i> 449, <i>&amp;c.</i>), and others think that it is the Hebrew expression <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צנועים‎</span> <i>the retired</i>. 12. Ewald (<i lang="de">Geschichte d. Volkes Israel</i>, iv. <i>p.</i> 420), is sure that it is the Rabbinic <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חזן‎</span> servant (<i>of God</i>), and that the name was given to them because it was their only desire to be <span class="trans" title="therapeutai theou"><span lang="grc" class="grek">θεραπευταὶ θεοῦ</span></span>. 13. Graetz (<i lang="de">Geschichte der Juden</i> iii. <i>p.</i> 468, <i>second ed.</i>) will have it that it is from the Aramaic <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏סחא‎</span> <i>to bathe</i>, with Aleph prostheticum, and that it is the shorter form for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אסחאי צפרא‎</span> = <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏טובלי שחרית‎</span> <span class="trans" title="hēmierbaptistai"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἡμιερβαπτισταί</span></span> <i>hemerobaptists</i>; the Greek form <span class="trans" title="Essaios"><span lang="grc" class="grek">Ἐσσαῖος</span></span>, <span class="trans" title="Essaioi"><span lang="grc" class="grek">Ἐσσαῖοι</span></span> being nothing but <span class="sc">Assaï</span> or <span class="sc">Essaï</span> with <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ח‎</span> elided. 14. Dr. Löw (<i>Ben Chananja</i> vol. i. p. 352) never doubts but that they were called <i>Essenes</i> after their founder, whose name he tells us was <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ישי‎</span>, the disciple of Rabbi Joshua ben Perachja. 15. Dr. Adler (<i lang="de">Volkslehrer</i>, vi. <i>p.</i> 50), again submits that it is from the <span class="pageNum" id="pb30">[<a href="#pb30">30</a>]</span>Hebrew <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אסר‎</span> <i>to bind together</i>, <i>to associate</i>, and that they were called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אסרים‎</span> because they united together to keep the law. 16. Dr. Cohen suggests the Chaldee
root <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עשן‎</span> <i>to be strong</i>, and that they were called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עשיני‎</span> because of their strength of mind to endure sufferings and to subdue their passions.
(<i>Comp. Frankel’s <span lang="de">Monatschrift</span></i> viii. <i>p.</i> 272). 17. Oppenheim thinks that it may be the form <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עושין‎</span> and stand for <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עושין טהרת הקדש‎</span> or <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עושין טהרת חטאת‎</span> <i>observers of the laws of purity and holiness</i>. (<i>Ibid</i>). 18. Jellinek (<i>Ben Chananja</i> iv. 374), again derives it from the Hebrew <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חצן‎</span> <i>sinus</i>, <span class="trans" title="perizōma"><span lang="grc" class="grek">περίζωμα</span></span>, alluding to <i>the apron</i> which the Essenes wore; whilst, 19, Others again derived it from <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חסיא‎</span> <i>pious</i>. The two last-mentioned explanations seem to have much to recommend them, they are
natural and expressive of the characteristics of the brotherhood. I, however, incline
to prefer the last, because it plainly connects the Essenes with an ancient Jewish
brotherhood called <i>Chassidim</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חסידים‎</span> <i>the pious</i>, who preceded the Essenes, and from whom the latter took their rise. Those who wish
to trace this connection, will find an article on <i>the Chassidim</i> in Dr. Alexander’s edition of <span class="sc">Kitto’s Cyclopædia of Biblical Literature</span>.

<p class="first">I shall now give in chronological order the description of the Essenes found in the

subjoin such notes as will explain the difficulties, and show the historical value
of the respective documents.
</p>
<p>As Philo is the oldest in point of time, we will begin with him. The exact date of
the birth of this celebrated Jewish-Alexandrian philosopher is not known. It is, however,
generally agreed that he was born in Alexandria between the years 20 and 1 <span class="asc">B.C.</span>, and died about 60 <span class="asc">A.D.</span> Having resided all his lifetime in Alexandria, his information about the Essenes,
who lived in Palestine, was derived from hearsay. This will account for some of the
inaccuracies in his description of this remarkable brotherhood. He has given us two
accounts of them, one in his treatise, entitled <i>Every Virtuous Man is Free</i>, and the other in his treatise, called <i>Apology for the Jews</i>. The latter is no longer extant, but Eusebius has preserved the fragments which speak
of the Essenes in his work, entitled <i lang="la">Præparatio Evangelica</i> viii. 11. The description of the so-called contemplative Essenes, or Therapeutæ,
which is generally appealed to as illustrating the doctrines and practices of the
brotherhood in question, has nothing whatever to do with the real Palestinian Essenes;
and it is almost certain that it is one of the many apocryphal productions fathered
upon Philo, as may be seen from Graetz’s elaborate and masterly analysis of it.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1550src" href="#xd31e1550">19</a> Philo’s first account is contained in his treatise entitled <i>Every Virtuous Man is Free</i>, and is as follows:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1555src" href="#xd31e1555">20</a>
<span class="pageNum" id="pb32">[<a href="#pb32">32</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Palestine, and Syria too, which are inhabited by no slight portion of the numerous
population of the Jews, are not barren of virtue. There are some among them called
Essenes (<span class="trans" title="Essaioi"><span lang="grc" class="grek">Ἐσσαῖοι</span></span>),—in number more than four thousand,—from, as I think, an incorrect derivation from
the Greek homonym <i>hosiotes</i>, holiness (<span class="trans" title="parōnymoi hosiotētos"><span lang="grc" class="grek">παρώνυμοι ὁσιότητος</span></span>), because they are above all others worshippers of God (<span class="trans" title="therapeutai theou"><span lang="grc" class="grek">θεραπευταὶ θεοῦ</span></span>). They do not sacrifice any animate, but rather endeavour to make their own minds
fit for holy offering (<span class="trans" title="hieroprepeis dianoias"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἱεροπρεπεῖς διανοίας</span></span>).<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1601src" href="#xd31e1601">21</a> They, in the first place, live in villages, avoiding cities on account of the habitual
wickedness of the citizens, being sensible that as disease is contracted from breathing
an impure atmosphere, so an incurable impression is made on the soul in such evil
company.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1666src" href="#xd31e1666">22</a> Some of them cultivate the earth, others are engaged in those diverse arts which
promote peace, thus <span class="pageNum" id="pb33">[<a href="#pb33">33</a>]</span>benefiting themselves and their neighbours. They do not lay up treasures of gold or
silver,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1677src" href="#xd31e1677">23</a> nor do they acquire large portions of land out of a desire for revenues, but provide
themselves only with the absolute necessities of life. Although they are almost the
only persons of all mankind who are without wealth and possessions—and this by their
own choice rather than want of success—yet they regard themselves as the richest,
because they hold that the supply of our wants, and contentment of mind, are riches,
as in truth they are.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1683src" href="#xd31e1683">24</a>
</p>
<p>“No maker of arrows, darts, spears, swords, helmets, breastplates, or shields—no manufacturer
of arms or engines of war, nor any man whatever who makes things belonging to war,
or even such things as might lead to wickedness in times of peace, is to be found
among them.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1694src" href="#xd31e1694">25</a> Traffic, innkeeping, or navigation, they never so much as dream of, because they
repudiate every inducement to covetousness. There is not a single slave to be found
among them, for all are free, and mutually serve each other. They condemn owners of
slaves, not only as unjust, inasmuch as they corrupt the principle of equality, but
also as impious, because they destroy the law of nature, which like a mother brought
forth and nourished all alike, and made them all legitimate brethren, not only in
word but in deed; but this relationship, treacherous covetousness, rendered overbearing
by success, has destroyed by engendering enmity instead of cordiality, and hatred
instead of love.
</p>
<p>“They leave the logical part of philosophy, as in no respect necessary for the acquisition
of virtue, to the word catchers; and the natural part, as being too difficult for
human nature, to the astrological babblers, excepting that part of it which treats
upon the existence of God and the origin of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb34">[<a href="#pb34">34</a>]</span>universe;<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1704src" href="#xd31e1704">26</a> but the ethical part they thoroughly work out themselves, using as their guides the
laws which their fathers inherited, and which it would have been impossible for the
human mind to devise without divine inspiration. Herein they instruct themselves at
all times, but more especially on the seventh day. For the seventh day is held holy,
on which they abstain from all other work, and go to the sacred places called synagogues,
sit according to order, the younger below the elder, and listen with becoming attention.
Then one takes the Bible and reads it, and another of those who have most experience
comes forward and expounds it, passing over that which is not generally known, for
they philosophise on most things in symbols according to the ancient zeal.
</p>
<p>“They are instructed in piety, holiness, righteousness, economy, politics, in knowledge
of what is truly good, bad and indifferent, to choose things that are necessary, and
to avoid the contrary. They use therein a threefold rule and definition, viz.: love
of God, love of virtue, and love of mankind.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1712src" href="#xd31e1712">27</a> Of their love to God, they give innumerable demonstrations—<i>e.g.</i> their constant and unalterable holiness (<span class="trans" title="hagneia"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἁγνεία</span></span>) throughout the whole of their life; their avoidance of oaths<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1728src" href="#xd31e1728">28</a> and falsehoods, and their firm belief that God is the source of all good, but of
nothing evil. Of their love of virtue they give proofs in their contempt for money,
fame, and pleasures, <span class="pageNum" id="pb35">[<a href="#pb35">35</a>]</span>their continence, endurance, in their satisfying their wants easily, simplicity, cheerfulness
of temper, modesty, order, firmness, and every thing of the kind. As instances of
their love to man, are to be mentioned, their benevolence, equality, and their having
all things in common, which is beyond all description, and about which it will not
be out of place to speak here a little.
</p>
<p>“First then, no one has his own house, so that it also belongs to all. For, besides
that, they all live together in sodalities; it is also open to those of the brotherhood
who come from other places. Moreover, they have all one common treasury and store
of provisions, common garments, and common food for all who eat together. Such a mode
of sleeping together, living together, and eating together, could not be so easily
established in fact among any other people; and indeed it would be impossible. For
whatever they receive daily, if they work for wages, they do not retain it as their
own, but give it to the common stock, and let every one that likes make common use
of it.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1758src" href="#xd31e1758">29</a> Those that are sick are not neglected because they can earn nothing, but have what
is necessary for their aid from the common stock, so that they ever fare richly without
wanting anything. They manifest respect, reverence and care for the aged, just as
children do for their parents, administering to them a thousand times with all plentifulness
both with their hands and their counsels in their old age.
</p>
<p>“Such champions of virtue does a philosophy produce which is free from the subtlety
of Greek word-splitting, and which deals with subjects tending to the exercise of
praiseworthy actions, and giving rise to invincible freedom. This was seen in the
fact that many tyrants have arisen from time to time in that country, differing in
character and conduct. <span class="pageNum" id="pb36">[<a href="#pb36">36</a>]</span>Some of them endeavoured to surpass in ferocity wild beasts; they omitted no manner
of barbarity, they sacrificed the vanquished in whole troops, or, like butchers, cut
off pieces and limbs of those that were still living, and did not leave off till retributive
justice, which governs the affairs of man, plunged them into similar miseries. Others,
again, converted their frenzy and madness into a different kind of wickedness. They
adopted an inexpressible bitterness, spake gently, and betrayed a ferocious temper
under the mask of gentle language;<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1771src" href="#xd31e1771">30</a> they fawned like poisonous dogs, and brought about irremediable miseries, leaving
behind them in the cities, as monuments of their impiety and hatred of mankind, the
never to be forgotten miseries. But neither the cruel tyrant nor the wily hypocrite
could get any advantage over the said brotherhood of Essenes or <i>holy ones</i> (<span class="trans" title="Essaiōn ē hosiōn"><span lang="grc" class="grek">Ἐσσαίων <span class="corr" id="xd31e1782" title="Source: ἤ">ἢ</span> ὁσίων</span></span>), but disarmed by the virtues of these men, all recognised them as independent and
free by nature, praised their common meals and their community of goods, which surpasses
all description, and is an evident proof of a perfect and very happy life.”
</p>
<p>Philo’s second account, which has been preserved by Eusebius in his <i>Praep. Evàng.</i>, viii, 11, from the lost treatise entitled <i>Apology for the Jews</i>, is as follows:—<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1800src" href="#xd31e1800">31</a>
</p>
<p>“Our lawgiver, Moses, formed innumerable (<span class="trans" title="myrious"><span lang="grc" class="grek">μυρίους</span></span>) disciples into a fellowship called Essenes,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1817src" href="#xd31e1817">32</a> who, as it appears, obtained this appellation by virtue of their holiness (<span class="trans" title="para tēn hosiotēta"><span lang="grc" class="grek">παρὰ τὴν ὁσιότητα</span></span>). They dwell in many cities of Judea, and in villages, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb37">[<a href="#pb37">37</a>]</span>in large and populous communities. Their order is not founded upon natural descent,
but upon admiration for virtue and sincere love for man. Hence there are properly
speaking no newly born ones among the Essenes, no children, no youths, as the dispositions
of these are unstable and liable to change from the imperfections incident to their
age;<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1838src" href="#xd31e1838">33</a> but they are all full grown men who are already approaching old age; and are no longer
carried away by the impetuosity of their bodily passions, but possess the genuine
and the only true and real liberty. A proof of their freedom is to be found in their
life. None of them strives to acquire any private property, house, slave, farm, flocks,
herds, or anything which might be regarded as a source of riches, but they all give
everything to the common stock from which the common wants of all are alike supplied.
</p>
<p>“They all dwell together in the same place, form themselves into companies, societies,
combinations and unions,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1851src" href="#xd31e1851">34</a> and work together all their life for the common good of the brotherhood. The different
members of the order are engaged in different employment; they work cheerfully and
industriously, and never try to leave their employment on account of cold, heat, or
any change of weather. They go to their daily work before the sun rises, and do not
leave off till some time after it has set, when they return home rejoicing no less
than those who have been exercising themselves in gymnastic contests.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1857src" href="#xd31e1857">35</a> They believe that their employment is a sort of gymnastic exercise of more benefit
to life, greater pleasure both to soul and body, and of a more enduring advantage
than any mere athletic labours, because they can cheerfully continue in their <span class="pageNum" id="pb38">[<a href="#pb38">38</a>]</span>work as a recreation even when youth and bodily strength are gone. Those who are acquainted
with the cultivation of the land are engaged in agriculture; others, again, who understand
the management of animals, attend to the flocks; some are skillful in the management
of bees; and others again, are artizans and manufacturers, thus guarding against the
want of anything. They do not omit anything which is requisite to supply the absolute
necessities of life.
</p>
<p>“The appointed steward and general manager receives the wages which the different
people get for their respective employments, and forthwith buys plenty of food and
other necessaries of life. They eat at the same table, and have every day the same
food, being lovers of frugality and moderation, and averse to luxury and extravagance
as a disease of both mind and body. Not only is their table in common, but their dress
too is in common. They have a store of rough cloaks in the winter, and in the summer
cheap garments without sleeves, to which every one can go and freely take whichever
kind he wants, for whatever belongs to one belongs to all, and whatever belongs to
all belongs to each individual.
</p>
<p>“If one of them is sick, he is cured from the common resources, and is attended to
by the general care and anxiety of the whole body. The old men, even if they happen
to be childless,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1868src" href="#xd31e1868">36</a> end their lives in a most happy, prosperous and tenderly cared for old age, as if
they were not only the fathers of many children, but were even also particularly happy
in an affectionate offspring. They are looked upon by such a number of people as worthy
of so much honour and provident regard, that they think themselves bound to care for
them even more from inclination than from any tie of natural affection.
</p>
<p>“Perceiving, with more than ordinary acuteness and accuracy, what is alone, or at
least above all other things, calculated <span class="pageNum" id="pb39">[<a href="#pb39">39</a>]</span>to dissolve such connections, they repudiate marriage; and at the same time practice
continence in an eminent degree. For no one of the Essenes marries a wife, because
woman is a selfish and excessively jealous creature, and has great power to destroy
the morals of man, and to mislead with continual tricks; for she is always devising
flattering speeches and other kinds of hypocrisy as on a stage; bewitching the eyes
and the ears; and when they are subjugated like things stultified, she proceeds to
undermine the ruling intellect.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1880src" href="#xd31e1880">37</a>
</p>
<p>“But when she has children, the woman becomes full of pride and arrogance, audaciously
speaks out that which she previously merely indicated in treacherous disguise, and
without any shame compels one to do whatever is hostile to the brotherhood; for he
who is chained by the charms of a woman or cares for children by necessity of nature,
is no longer the same person to others, but is entirely changed, having unawares become
a slave instead of a free man.
<span class="pageNum" id="pb40">[<a href="#pb40">40</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Such is the enviable system of life of the Essenes, so that not only private individuals
but even mighty kings have admired them, venerated their brotherhood, and rendered
their dignity and nobleness still higher by the praise and honours which they lavished
upon them.”
</p>
<p>Next, in point of time, is Caius Plinius Secundus, called Major, or the elder, the
celebrated author of the <i lang="la">Historia Naturalis</i>, who was born in <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 23, and died <span class="asc">A.D.</span> 79. Pliny’s notice of the Essenes, which is to be found in his Natural History, book
v., chap, xvii., is as follows:
</p>
<p>“Towards the west [of the sea] and sufficiently distant from it, so as to escape its
noxious exhalations (<i lang="la">ab occidente litora Esseni fugiunt, usque qua nocent</i>), are the Essenes. They are a hermitical society, marvellous beyond all others throughout
the whole earth. They live without any women, without gratifying sensual desires,
without money, and in the company of palm trees. Their ranks are daily made up by
multitudes of new comers who resort to them; and who being weary of life, and driven
by the surges of ill-fortune, adopt their manner of life. Thus it is that, through
thousands of ages (<i lang="la">per saeculorum millia</i>),<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1955src" href="#xd31e1955">38</a> incredible to relate, this people prolongs its existence without any one being born
among them: so fruitful to them are the weary lives of others.”
</p>
<p>Next in point of time is Josephus, or Joseph ben Matthias, better known by the name
Flavius Josephus, who was born in Jerusalem about 37, <span class="asc">A.D.</span> The description which this learned Jewish warrior and historian gives us of the Essenes,
although somewhat marred by being made to harmonise with the systems of Greek philosophy,
is very important, inasmuch as Josephus was not only a Palestinian Jew, but at one
period of his life had actually joined the brotherhood. He tells us in his autobiography,
that when sixteen years old he determined to <span class="pageNum" id="pb41">[<a href="#pb41">41</a>]</span>examine for himself the respective merits of the three predominant sects, viz., of
the Pharisees, Sadducees and Essenes, with the view of making a selection from among
them. His accounts of the Essenes are dispersed through his works. The following is
the first description contained in his <i>Jewish War</i>, book ii, chap. viii, sec. 2–13.
</p>
<p>“§ 2. There are three sects of philosophers among the Jews. The followers of the first
are called Pharisees, of the second Sadducees, and of the third, who really seem to
practise holiness, Essenes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1976src" href="#xd31e1976">39</a> Jews by birth, they love each other more than the others.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e1984src" href="#xd31e1984">40</a> They reject pleasure as an evil, and regard continence and not yielding to passions
as virtues. They despise marriage, and adopt the children of others while still tender
and susceptible of instruction,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2010src" href="#xd31e2010">41</a> and regard them as their own relations, and train them in their practices. They do
not, however, repudiate marriage, and its consequent, succession of the race in themselves;
but they are afraid of the lasciviousness of women, and are persuaded that none of
them preserve their fidelity to one man.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2025src" href="#xd31e2025">42</a>
</p>
<p>“§ 3. They despise riches, have all things in common in a very admirable manner, and
there is not one to be found among them who is richer than another; for it is a law
that those who enter the sect must give up their possessions to the <span class="pageNum" id="pb42">[<a href="#pb42">42</a>]</span>society as common property,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2038src" href="#xd31e2038">43</a> so that there is not to be seen among them all, either the abjectness of poverty
or the distinction of riches; but as every man’s goods are cast into a common treasury,
they all, like brothers, have one patrimony. They regard ointment as defiling; and
if one happens to be anointed against his will, he immediately wipes it off his body.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2053src" href="#xd31e2053">44</a> To be unadorned but dressed in white they regard as commendable. They have stewards
of their common property, appointed by general election, and every one without distinction
is proposed for all the offices.
</p>
<p>“§ 4. They have no separate city, but some of them live anywhere; and if any of the
society come from other places, whatever they have lies open for them, just as if
it were their own; and they go to those whom they have never seen before as if they
had been most intimate. Hence they take nothing with them when they go on a journey,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2065src" href="#xd31e2065">45</a> but arms for defence against robbers. A steward is appointed in every city of this
order to provide strangers with clothes and other necessaries.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2074src" href="#xd31e2074">46</a> The keeping and appearance of their body are such as of children brought up in fear;
they change neither garments nor shoes till they are worn out or made unfit by time.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2085src" href="#xd31e2085">47</a> They neither sell nor buy anything among themselves, but everyone gives of that which
he has to him that wants, and gets from <span class="pageNum" id="pb43">[<a href="#pb43">43</a>]</span>him that which he needs; and even without requital they can freely take whatever they
want.
</p>
<p>“§ 5. Their piety towards God is extraordinary, for they never speak about worldly
matters before the sun rises, but offer up, with their faces towards it, some of the
prayers transmitted by their forefathers, as if they supplicated it to rise.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2095src" href="#xd31e2095">48</a> Hereupon, they are all sent by the overseers, every one to work in the department
in which he is skilled; and, having diligently laboured till the fifth hour, assemble
again together in one place, girt round with their linen apron, and have a baptism
with cold water.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2133src" href="#xd31e2133">49</a> After this lustration they resort to a special house, in which no one of another
faith is admitted, and go to the refectory purified as into a holy temple.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2146src" href="#xd31e2146">50</a> Having quietly taken their seats the baker gives every one a loaf of bread according
to order, and the cook places before each one a dish with one sort of food. The priest
commences with prayer, and no one is allowed to taste his food before grace is said.
He also returns thanks after the meal; for both at the commencement and at the conclusion
they praise God as the giver of their food.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2159src" href="#xd31e2159">51</a> <span class="pageNum" id="pb44">[<a href="#pb44">44</a>]</span>Whereupon they put off their white garments as if they were sacred, and betake themselves
again to their work till evening. On returning again they take their supper together,
at which strangers, who happen to be in the place, are allowed to sit down with them.
No noise or tumult ever desecrates their house, but they let every one take part in
the conversation in turn; and the silence of those who are within appears to those
that are without as some awful mystery. The cause of this is the uninterrupted sobriety,
as well as the fact that their eating and drinking are so measured out as just to
suffice the cravings of nature.
</p>
<p>“§ 6. Whilst they do nothing without the injunctions of their overseers, yet there
are two things in which they have free action, viz., helping the needy, and shewing
mercy; to help the deserving when they are in want, and to give food to the hungry,
they have perfect liberty; but to give anything to their relations they are not allowed
without the permission of the overseers. They are just dispensers of their anger,
curbers of their passions, representatives of fidelity, ministers of peace; and every
word with them is of more force than an oath. They avoid taking an oath, and regard
it as worse than perjury; for they say that he who is not believed without calling
on God to witness is already condemned of falsehood.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2166src" href="#xd31e2166">52</a> They take extraordinarily great pains in studying the writings of the ancients, and
select that especially which is beneficial both for the soul and body; hence they
investigate medical roots and the property of minerals for the cure of distempers.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2172src" href="#xd31e2172">53</a>
</p>
<p>“§ 7. When any one desires to enter the sect, he is not immediately admitted, but
although he has to remain a whole <span class="pageNum" id="pb45">[<a href="#pb45">45</a>]</span>year without, yet he is obliged to observe their ascetic rules of living, and they
give him an axe, an apron as mentioned above, and a white garment.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2210src" href="#xd31e2210">54</a> If he has given proof of continence during this time, he approaches nearer to their
life and partakes of the holier water of purification; but is still not as yet admitted
to their common table. Having thus given proof of his perseverance, his conduct is
tested two more years, and, if found worthy, he is admitted into the society. But
before he touches the common meal, he swears, by most awful oaths,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2232src" href="#xd31e2232">55</a> first to fear God, and next to exercise justice towards all men—neither to wrong
any one of his own accord nor by the command of others; always to detest the wicked
and side with the righteous; ever to keep faith inviolable with all men, especially
with those in authority, for no one comes to office without the will of God;<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2235src" href="#xd31e2235">56</a> not to be proud of his power nor to outshine his subordinates, either in his garments
or greater finery, if he himself should <span class="pageNum" id="pb46">[<a href="#pb46">46</a>]</span>attain to office; always to love truth and strive to reclaim all liars; to keep his
hands clear from stealing, and his mind from unholy gain; not to conceal anything
from the brotherhood, nor disclose anything belonging to them to those without, though
it were at the hazard of his life. He has, moreover, to swear not to communicate to
any one their doctrines in any other way than he has received them;<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2246src" href="#xd31e2246">57</a> to abstain from robbing the commonwealth; and equally to preserve the writings of
the society and the names of the angels.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2249src" href="#xd31e2249">58</a> By such oaths they bind those who enter the brotherhood.
</p>
<p>“§ 8. Such as are caught in heinous sins are excommunicated from the society; and
the excommunicated frequently die a miserable death. For, being bound by oaths and
customs, they cannot receive food from any out of the society, so that they are forced
to eat herbs till, their bodies being famished with hunger, they perish.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2259src" href="#xd31e2259">59</a> Hence they compassionately receive many of them again when they are at their last
gasp, thinking that suffering, approaching unto death, is sufficient for their sins.
</p>
<p>“§ 9. In their verdicts they are most exact and just, and never give sentence if there
are less than a hundred of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb47">[<a href="#pb47">47</a>]</span>brotherhood present: but what is then decreed is irrevocable. Next to God they have
the highest veneration for the name of the lawgiver, Moses, and punish with death
any one who blasphemes it. To submit to the elders and to the majority they regard
as a duty: hence, when ten of them sit together, no one will speak if the other nine
do not agree to it. They avoid spitting before the face, or to the right hand,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2284src" href="#xd31e2284">60</a> and are also stricter than all other Jews not to touch any labour on the Sabbath
day—for they not only prepare their Sabbath-day’s food the day before, that they may
not kindle a fire on that day, but they will not move a vessel out of its place<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2295src" href="#xd31e2295">61</a> nor go to ease nature. On all other days they dig a pit of a foot deep with the spade
(such an one being given to the novice), and having covered it all round with a cover,
that it may not offend the Divine rays, they set themselves over it, and then put
the earth, that was dug out again into the pit; and do this, after having chosen the
most lonely places. And although the voiding of bodily excrements is natural, yet
it is their custom to bathe after it, as if they had been defiled.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2303src" href="#xd31e2303">62</a>
</p>
<p>“§ 10. They are divided, according to the time of leading this mode of life, into
four different classes, and the juniors are so much inferior to the seniors, that
the latter must wash themselves when they happen to touch the former, as if they had
been defiled by a stranger.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2312src" href="#xd31e2312">63</a> They live to a great age, so <span class="pageNum" id="pb48">[<a href="#pb48">48</a>]</span>that many of them live to above a hundred years—arising from the simplicity of their
diet, as it appears to me, and from their order. They despise suffering, and overcome
pain by fortitude. Death, if connected with honour, they look upon as better than
long life. Of the firmness of their minds in all cases the war with the Romans has
given ample proof; in which, though they were tortured, racked, burned, squeezed,
and subjected to all the instruments of torment, that they might be forced to blaspheme
the lawgiver or eat what was forbidden, yet they could not be made to do either of
them; nor would they even once flatter their tormentors or shed a tear, but, smiling
through their torments and mocking their tormentors, they cheerfully yielded up their
souls, as those who would soon receive them back again.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2319src" href="#xd31e2319">64</a>
</p>
<p>“§ 11. For they firmly believe that the bodies perish and their substance is not enduring,
but that the souls are immortal—continue for ever and come out of the most subtile
ether—are enveloped by their bodies, to which they are attracted through a natural
inclination, as if by hedges—and that when freed from the bonds of the body, they,
as if released from a long servitude, rejoice and mount upwards. In harmony with the
opinion of the Greeks,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2328src" href="#xd31e2328">65</a> they say that for the good souls there is a life beyond the ocean, and a region which
is never molested either with showers or snow or intense heat—is always refreshed
with the gentle gales of wind constantly breathing from the ocean; whilst to the wicked
souls they assign a dark and cold corner, full of never-ceasing punishments. And it
seems to be according to the same opinion that the Greeks assigned to their valiant
men, whom they called heroes and demigods, the Island of the Blessed, but to the souls
of the wicked the regions of the impious in Hades; <span class="pageNum" id="pb49">[<a href="#pb49">49</a>]</span>as also their fables speak of several there punished, as Sisyphus and Tantalus and
Ixion and Tityus. This they teach, partly because they believe that the souls are
immortal, and partly for the encouragement of virtue and the discouragement of vice.
For good men are made better in their lives by the hope of reward after their death,
whilst the passions of the wicked are restrained by the fear they are in that, although
they should be concealed in this life, after death they must suffer everlasting punishment.
This is the doctrine of the Essenes about the soul—possessing thereby an irresistible
bait for those who have once tasted their philosophy.
</p>
<p>“§ 12. There are also some among them who undertake to foretell future events, having
been brought up from their youth in the study of the sacred Scripture, in divers purifications,
and in the sayings of the prophets; and it is very seldom that they fail in their
predictions.
</p>
<p>“§ 13. There is also another order of Essenes who, in their way of living, customs,
and laws exactly agree with the others, excepting only that they differ from them
about marriage. For they believe that those who do not marry cut off the principal
part of human life—that is, succession—especially that, if all were of the same opinion,
the whole race would soon be extinguished. They, however, try their spouses for three
years, and after giving evidence, by three natural purgations, that they are fit to
bear children, they marry them. They have no connubial intercourse with them when
with child, to show that they do not marry to gratify lust, but only to have children.
The women, too, have their garments on when they have baths, just as the men have
on their aprons. Such are the customs of this brotherhood.”
</p>
<p>The next mention which Josephus makes of them is in his Antiq. Book xiii. chap. v.
§ 9, and is as follows:—
</p>
<p>“§ 9. At this time [166 <span class="asc">B.C.</span>] there were three sects (<span class="trans" title="haireseis"><span lang="grc" class="grek">αἱρέσεις</span></span>) <span class="pageNum" id="pb50">[<a href="#pb50">50</a>]</span>among the Jews, differing in their opinion about human affairs. The first was called
the sect of the Pharisees, the second the sect of the Sadducees, and the third the
sect of the Essenes. The Pharisees affirm that some things only, but not all, are
the work of fate (<span class="trans" title="tēs heimarmenēs"><span lang="grc" class="grek">τῆς εἱμαρμένης</span></span>), and some are in our own power, whether they should take place or whether they should
not occur; the sect of the Essenes maintain that fate governs all things,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2360src" href="#xd31e2360">66</a> and that nothing can befal man contrary to its determination and will (<span class="trans" title="psēphos"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ψῆφος</span></span>); whilst the Sadducees reject fate, saying that there is no such thing, and that
human events do not proceed from it, and ascribe all to ourselves, so that we ourselves
are the cause of our fortunes, and receive what is evil from our own inconsiderateness.
However, I have given a more minute description of this in the second book of the
Jewish War.”
</p>
<p>He speaks of them again in Antiq. Book xv. chap. x. § 4, towards the end, and § 5,
as follows:—
</p>
<p>“§ 4. The Essenes, as we call them, were also exempted from this necessity [of taking
an oath of allegiance to Herod]. These men live the same kind of life which among
the Greeks has been ordered by Pythagoras.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2399src" href="#xd31e2399">67</a> I have discoursed more fully about them elsewhere. The reason, however, why Herod
had the Essenes in such honour, and thought more highly of them than of mortal nature,
is worthy of record. For this account, too, is not unsuitable for this history, inasmuch
as it shows the people’s opinion about the Essenes.
</p>
<p>“§ 5. There was a certain Essene, named Menahem (<span class="trans" title="Menaēmos"><span lang="grc" class="grek">Μενάημος</span></span> <span class="pageNum" id="pb51">[<a href="#pb51">51</a>]</span>= <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מנחם‎</span>) who was celebrated not only for the uprightness of his conduct, but also for the
fore-knowledge of the future proceeding from God. When he once saw Herod, as a boy
going to school, he addressed him by the name of ‘King of the Jews.’<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2422src" href="#xd31e2422">68</a> Herod thought that he did not know him or that he jested, and reminded him that he
was of common origin. But Menahem smiled on him most <span class="corr" id="xd31e2429" title="Source: friendlily">friendly</span>, clapped him on the back with his hand, and said—‘Thou wilt, nevertheless, be king,
and wilt begin thy reign happily, for God has found thee worthy of it. And remember
the blows that Menahem has given thee, as being the symbol of the change of thy fortune.
For this assurance will be salutary for thee when thou wilt love justice and piety
towards God and equity towards thy citizens. However, I know that thou wilt not be
such a one, for I can perceive it all. Thou wilt, indeed, excel more than any one
in happiness, and obtain an everlasting reputation, but thou wilt forget piety and
justice. This will not be concealed from God, for he will visit thee with his wrath
for it, towards the end of thy life.’ Herod paid very little attention to it at that
time, as he had no hope of it. But as he soon afterwards advanced to the dignity of
king and was happy, he ordered Menahem to come to him in the height of his dominion,
and asked him how long he should reign; but Menahem did not tell him. Seeing that
he was silent, he asked again whether he should reign ten years. Whereupon he replied,
‘Yes; twenty, nay, thirty years;’ but did not determine the exact limit of his reign.
Herod, rejoicing on it, gave Menahem his hand and dismissed him, and from that time
continued to honour the Essenes. I thought of relating this to the readers (though
to some it may seem incredible), and of making <span class="pageNum" id="pb52">[<a href="#pb52">52</a>]</span>it known, as it concerns us, because many of the Essenes are highly esteemed for their
virtuous conduct and knowledge of Divine things.”
</p>
<p>Josephus also relates instances in which Essenes foretold future events, in Antiq.,
book xviii., chap, ii., § 2; book xviii., chap. xiii. § 3; and Jewish War, book 1,
chap. iii., § 5.
</p>
<p>The last account which Josephus gives us is to be found in his Antiq., book xviii.,
chap, i., § 2 and 5.
</p>
<p>“§ 2. There have been three philosophies among the Jews ever since the ancient time
of the fathers (<span class="trans" title="ek tou pany archaiou tōn patriōn"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἐκ τοῦ <span class="corr" id="xd31e2443" title="Source: πάνυἀρχαίου">πάνυ ἀρχαίου</span> τῶν πατρίων</span></span>), that of the Essenes, and that of the Sadducees, and a third which the so-called
Pharisees followed. Although I have already spoken of them in the second book of the
Jewish War, yet will I mention here also something about them.
</p>
<p>“§ 5. The doctrine of the Essenes delights in leaving all to God (<span class="trans" title="Theō katalipein philei ta panta"><span lang="grc" class="grek">Θεῷ καταλιπεῖν φιλεῖ τὰ πάντα</span></span>). They regard the soul as immortal, and say that the attainment to virtue must be
fought for with all our might. Although they send consecrated gifts to the Temple,
yet they never bring any sacrifice on account of the different rules of purity which
they observe; hence, being excluded from the common sanctuary, they offer sacrifices
in themselves (spiritually). Otherwise, they are in their manner of life the best
of men, and employ themselves wholly in the labour of agriculture. Their uprightness
is to be admired above all others who endeavour to practice virtue; such uprightness,
which is by no means to be found among the Greeks and foreigners, is not of recent
date, but has existed among them from times of yore (<span class="trans" title="ek palaiou"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἐκ παλαιοῦ</span></span>), striving most scrupulously not to disturb the community of goods, and that the
rich should not enjoy more of the common property than the poor. This is the conduct
of this people who are more than four thousand in number. They never marry wives,
nor endeavour after the possession of property; <span class="pageNum" id="pb53">[<a href="#pb53">53</a>]</span>for they believe that the latter leads to injustice, and the former yields opportunities
for domestic discord. Living by themselves they serve each other. They choose good
men, who are also priests, to be the stewards of their incomes and the produce of
the fields, as well as to procure the corn and food. They do not differ at all in
their living, but are more like those whom the Dacae call Polistae.”
</p>
<p>We notice next the account of Caius Julius Solinus, the author of the Geographical
compendium called <i>Polyhistor</i>, who flourished about 238 <span class="asc">A.D.</span> His accounts, which are to be found in chap. xxxv. § 7–10 of his work, are evidently
derived from Pliny.
</p>
<p>“In the interior of Judea, towards the west, are the Essenes, who differ from the
usages of all other nations in their marvellous constitutions, and who, according
to my opinion, have been appointed by divine providence for this mode of life. No
woman is to be found there; connubial pleasures they have entirely renounced; money
they know not, and palm-berries are their food.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2484src" href="#xd31e2484">69</a> Not a single birth takes place there, and yet there is no want of population. The
place itself is devoted to modesty. Although a very large number of persons run to
it from all quarters, yet none is admitted who is not thought to possess purity, fidelity
and innocence; for, if one has been guilty of the slightest misdemeanour, though he
endeavour to obtain admission by offering never so large a fortune, he is excluded
by a divine decree. Thus it is that through an immense space of ages (<i lang="la">per immensum spatium saeculorum</i>), incredible to relate,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2501src" href="#xd31e2501">70</a> this society is perpetuated though no child is born among them.”
<span class="pageNum" id="pb54">[<a href="#pb54">54</a>]</span></p>
<p>The next account is that of Porphyry, the neo-Platonic philosopher and celebrated
antagonist of Christianity, who was born 233 <span class="asc">A.D.</span> and died about 306 <span class="asc">A.D.</span> His description of the Essenes, which is given in his treatise <i>On the Abstinence from Animal Food</i> (<i lang="la">Lugduni ap. Morillon</i>, 1620, <i>p.</i> 381, <i>&amp;c.</i>), is, as he himself tells us, taken from Josephus. He has, however, made some alterations,
as may be seen from the following:
</p>
<p>“There were three sorts of philosophers among the Jews, the first were headed by the
Pharisees, the second by the Sadducees, and the third, who seemed the most honourable
(<span class="trans" title="semnotatē"><span lang="grc" class="grek">σεμνοτάτη</span></span>), by the Essenes. The latter formed such a society as Josephus has described it in
different parts of his works, as well as in the second book of the Jewish History,
which he composed in seven books, as in the eighteenth book of his Antiquities, which
he composed in twenty books, and in the second part to the Greeks.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2534src" href="#xd31e2534">71</a>
</p>
<p>“The Essenes are Jews by birth, and love one another more than other people. They
avoid sensual enjoyments as vices, and regard continence and the power to resist the
passions as the first virtue; they despise marriage and adopt the children of strangers,
whilst still young and suitable for instruction, regard them as their own, and train
them in their usages. They do not repudiate matrimony and child birth in themselves,
but they guard against the sensuality of women. They despise riches, and there is
a wonderful community of goods among them. There is no one found among them who occupies
a distinguished position through his wealth; for they have a law that those who enter
the society give up their possessions to the brotherhood, so that there is no such
thing among them as abjectness of poverty or arrogance of riches; but the possessions
of all put together form a fraternal and common property. If one of them happens to
be inadvertently <span class="pageNum" id="pb55">[<a href="#pb55">55</a>]</span>anointed, he immediately washes his whole body; for they regard it as praiseworthy
to have a dry skin, and they are always dressed in white. They appoint stewards to
manage their common property; and every one, without distinction, is eligible for
all the offices.
</p>
<p>“They are not confined to one city, but live in different places, and everything they
have is at the service of the members who happen to come from another city. Though
meeting for the first time they at once salute each other as intimate friends (<span class="trans" title="isasin hōsper synētheis"><span lang="grc" class="grek"><span class="corr" id="xd31e2546" title="Source: ἵσασιν">ἴσασιν</span> ὥσπερ συνήθεις</span></span>); hence they travel without taking anything with them. They do not change either
garments or sandals till they are torn or worn out by age; they neither buy nor sell,
but every one gives of that which he has to him that wants it, and receives that which
he needs; but even without receiving anything in return they freely communicate to
him that wants. Their piety towards God is extraordinary. None of them speak about
anything profane before the sun rises; but they offer to it some of the prayers transmitted
to them by their forefathers, as if they supplicated it to rise, &amp;c., &amp;c.” He repeats
almost literally the whole of § 5 of Josephus <i>On the Jewish War</i>, book ii. chap. viii., which we have given above, p, 43.
</p>
<p>Porphyry omits § 6 of Josephus, but gives, with a few verbal alterations, both the
whole of § 7, which describes the admission into the order, and § 8, which describes
the punishment. He omits the greater part of § 9, and adds the following statement,
which is not to be found in Josephus. “Their food is so poor and scanty that they
do not require to ease nature on the Sabbath,<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2561src" href="#xd31e2561">72</a> which they devote to singing praises to God and to rest.” He omits from § 10 the
description of the division of the Essenes into four classes, and <span class="pageNum" id="pb56">[<a href="#pb56">56</a>]</span>simply mentions firmness in suffering and death. He also omits from § 11 the whole
piece beginning with the words “In harmony with the opinion of the Greeks, &amp;c.;” whilst
he not only gives the whole of § 12, but has also the following addition, “With such
a manner of life, and with their firm adhesion to truthfulness and piety, there are
naturally many among them who can foretel future events, &amp;c.;” and concludes with
the words, “This is the nature of the order of the Essenes among the Jews,” omitting
altogether what Josephus says in § 13 about those Essenes who marry.
</p>
<p>Epiphanius, bishop of Constantia and metropolitan of Cyprus, who was born in Bezanduca,
a small town of Palestine, in the first part of the fourth century, and died in 403,
has also given us some brief notices of the Essenes in his celebrated work <i>Against the Heretics</i>. His first notice is to be found in <i>Adver. Haer.</i>, lib. i. ord. x. p. 28, ed. Col., 1682, under the title <i>Against the Essenes and the Samaritans</i>, and is as follows:
</p>
<p>“The Essenes continue in their first position, and have not altered at all. According
to them there have been some dissensions among the Gorthenes, in consequence of some
difference of opinion which has taken place among them—I mean among the Sebuens, Essenes
and Gorthenes. The difference of opinion relates to the following matter. The law
of Moses commands the Israelites of all places to come up to Jerusalem to the three
festivals, viz., the feasts of the Passover, Pentecost and Tabernacles. As the Jews
in Judea and Samaria were largely dispersed, it is supposed that those of them who
made their pilgrimage to Jerusalem went through Samaritan cities, and as the Samaritans
assemble at the same time to celebrate the festivals, a conflict arose between them.”
</p>
<p>Epiphanius speaks of them again (<i>Adv. Haer.</i>, lib. i. ord. xix. p. 39), and under the title, <i>Against the Ossenes</i> (<span class="trans" title="kata Ossēnōn"><span lang="grc" class="grek">κατὰ Ὀσσηνῶν</span></span>), as follows:
<span class="pageNum" id="pb57">[<a href="#pb57">57</a>]</span></p>
<p>“Next follow the Ossenes, who were closely connected with the former sect. They too
are Jews, hypocrites in their demeanour, and peculiar people in their conceits.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2592src" href="#xd31e2592">73</a> They originated, according to the tradition which I received, in the regions of Nabatea,
Itruria, Moabitis and Antilis, (<span class="trans" title="Arēïlitis"><span lang="grc" class="grek">Ἀρηϊλίτις</span></span>), in the surrounding neighbourhood of the so-called Dead Sea.… The name Ossenes,
according to its etymology, signifies <i>the stout race</i> (<span class="trans" title="stibyron genos"><span lang="grc" class="grek">στιβυρὸν γένος</span></span>).… A certain person named Elxai joined them at the time of the Emperor Trajan, after
the advent of the Saviour, who was a false prophet. He wrote a so-called prophetical
book, which he pretended to be according to divine wisdom. He had a brother named
<span class="sic">Jeeus</span>, who also misled people in their manner of life, and caused them to err with his
doctrine. A Jew by birth, and professing the Jewish doctrines, he did not live according
to the Mosaic law, but introduced quite different things, and misled his own sect.…
He joined the sect of the Ossenes, of which some remnants are still to be found in
the same regions of Nabatea and Perea towards Moabitis. These people are now called
<i>Simseans</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2618src" href="#xd31e2618">74</a>
</p>
<p>“But hear the Sadducee’s nonsense (<i>comp. ibid.</i>, <i>p.</i> 42): he rejects the sacrificial and altar services, as repulsive to the Deity, and
as things which, according to the meaning of the fathers and the Mosaic law, were
never offered to the Lord in a worthy manner. Yet he says that we must pray with our
faces to Jerusalem, where the sacrificial altar and the sacrifices have their place.
He rejects the eating of animal flesh which is common among the Jews, and other things;
nay, even the sacrificial altar and the sacrificial fire, as being foreign to the
<span class="pageNum" id="pb58">[<a href="#pb58">58</a>]</span>Deity. The purifying water, he says, is worthy of God, but the fire is unworthy, because
of the declaration of the prophet: ‘Children, go ye not there to see the fire of the
sacrifices, for ye err; yea, it is already an error to think such a thing.’ ‘If you
look at the fire very closely,’ says he, ‘it is still far off. Moreover, go ye not
to look at the sacrificial fire, but go ye rather to the doctrine of the water.…’
There is much more of such idle talk to be found among the Ossenes.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2638src" href="#xd31e2638">75</a>
</p>
<p>These are the sources from which writers upon the Essenes have, till within very lately,
drawn their information. As to the account of Eusebius (<i>comp. <span lang="la">Hist. Ecclesiast.</span></i>, <i>lib.</i> ii, <i>cap.</i> xvii), to which appeal is often made, it is nothing but a Christianized reproduction
of the so-called Philonic description of the Therapeutae. It would therefore be useless
to give it. In looking through these accounts, it will be seen that there are only
three independent ones among them, namely—Philo’s, Josephus’s and Pliny’s; as the
notice of Solinus is merely a repetition of Pliny, the description of Porphyry is
almost a literal reproduction of Josephus; whilst the distorted scraps of Epiphanius
are not only worse than useless, but are unworthy of him, and the account of Eusebius
is simply misleading, inasmuch as it is a repetition of an apocryphal story, which
has nothing to do with the Essenes.

<p class="first">Having given the ancient documents, all that now remains is that I should give a brief
sketch of the most important modern literature on the Essenes. In doing this part
of my task, as in the former, I shall try as much as it is possible to follow the
chronological order.
</p>
<p>1513–1577.—Accordingly De Rossi occupies the first position. In his erudite work,
called <i>Meor Enajim</i>, i.e., <i>The Light of the Eyes</i>, which is a Cyclopœdia of Biblical literature and criticism, this profound critic
gives us a brief notice of this brotherhood, in which he maintains that the Essenes
are identical with the Greek sect called <i>Baithusians</i> in the Talmud, and <i>Therapeutae</i> by Philo. His account is as follows: “It has often appeared to me strange that the
Talmud should say nothing whatever about that sect which obtained a good report among
the nations. I therefore examined the works of our sages, to ascertain whether I could
find in them any distinction made between the Sadducees and the Baithusians. And it
appeared to me that though both alike denied the traditional law (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏התורה שעל פה‎</span>), yet the Baithusians are no where charged with the sin of denying, like the Sadducees,
the immortality of the soul and future judgment. Moreover, I thought of the similarity
of the names Baithusians and Essenes (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ביתוסים איסיאי‎</span>), and especially of the manner in which the ancients changed names. Now, owing to
the word <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בית‎</span> being so frequently found prefixed to names of schools and families, the appellation
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ביתוסים‎</span> might easily have originated from a junction of the words <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בית איסיאי‎</span>. I also saw the passage in the Talmud, Sabbath, cap. viii, fol. 108, as quoted also
in Sopherim, cap. i, which is as follows:—‘A Baithusian <span class="pageNum" id="pb60">[<a href="#pb60">60</a>]</span>asked R. Joshuah whence do we know that phylacteries must not be written upon the
skin of an unclean animal?’ To which he replied—‘It is written that the Lord’s law
may be in thy mouth, ( Exod. xiii, 9 ) this signifies that phylacteries must be written upon the skin of an animal which
thou canst take into thy mouth, i.e., eat.’ To this he said—‘This being the case,
we must also not write the phylacteries upon the skin of an animal which died;’ [for
an Israelite is as much forbidden to taste the flesh of it, as to eat an unclean animal.]
Hereupon the Rabbi replied—‘I will tell thee a parable, to make the thing clear. Two
men are condemned to death: the one the king kills, and the other is killed by the
executioner: now, which of the two dost thou esteem higher? Surely the one whom the
king himself has executed. So the animal which died, [i.e., which the King of Kings
caused to die] must be preferred to the others.’ Whereupon the Baithusian said—‘Accordingly,
we ought also to eat it.’ R. Joshuah replied—‘The Bible prohibits it ( Deut. xiv ), and dost thou want to eat it?’ The Baithusian then said—‘<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קלוס‎</span><span class="corr" id="xd31e2694" title="Not in source">.’</span> This expression Rashi of blessed memory rightly says is Greek; i.e. <span class="corr" id="xd31e2696" title="Not in source">‘</span><span class="trans" title="kalon"><span lang="grc" class="grek">καλὸν</span></span>.’ Hence it is to be inferred that the Baithusian was a Greek; and, indeed, we know
from Philo and Josephus that the Essenes were also Greek Jews, living in Alexandria.…
From all these things I easily quieted my mind, and concluded that the Baithusians
are the same as the Essenes.’<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2705src" href="#xd31e2705">76</a> Now, from a careful perusal of the account given by Josephus of the Essenes, it will
be seen that he never describes them as Greek Jews. Besides, this is utterly at variance
with ancient tradition, as the Talmudic authorities most positively declare that the
Baithusians and Sadducees were both alike in doctrine, that both derived their names
from the founder of these sects, Baithos (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ביתוס‎</span>) and Zadok (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צדיק‎</span>), the disciples of Antigonus of Soho, and that they gave rise to these sects, through
misinterpreting <span class="pageNum" id="pb61">[<a href="#pb61">61</a>]</span>the following saying of their master<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2717src" href="#xd31e2717">77</a> which he had received from Simon the Just:—“Be not like servants who serve their
master for the sake of receiving a reward, but be ye like servants who serve their
master without the view of receiving a reward,” recorded in Aboth. i. 3. Upon this
Aboth d. R. Nathan (cap. v.) remarks, “Antigonus’ two disciples at first continued
implicitly to teach this saying to their disciples, and these again to their disciples.
At last, however, they began to ponder over it, and said—‘What did our fathers mean
by this saying? Is a labourer to labour all day and not receive his wages in the evening?
Now if our fathers had believed that there is another world, and a resurrection of
the dead, they would not have spoken thus.’ Hence they dissented from the law, and
from them originated the two sects, the Sadducees and the Baithusians, the Sadducees
from Sadok and the Baithusians from Baithus. They used gold and silver vessels all
the days of their life, not because they were proud, but because they said that the
Pharisees themselves have a tradition that they afflict themselves in this world,
and have nothing in the world to come.” From this we see that 1. The Baithusians,
like the Sadducees, derived their appellation from the proper name of their founder,
which is <i>Baithus</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ביתוס‎</span> so that the first part of the name <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בית‎</span> cannot be separated from it. 2. Like the Sadducees, the Baithusians denied the immortality
of the soul and the existence of angels, whereas the Essenes firmly believed in the
immortality of the soul, and made the angels play a very important part in their creed.
That the Sadducees and the Baithusians were considered to be identical, or, at all
events, to <span class="pageNum" id="pb62">[<a href="#pb62">62</a>]</span>hold similar doctrines is also evident from the fact that what is in one place of
the Talmud ascribed to the former, is in another place ascribed to the latter. Thus,
for instance, in Succa 48 <i>b</i>. the Sadducees are said to have questioned the necessity of bringing a libation of
water on the Feast of Tabernacles; in Tosifta Succa cap. iii. it is ascribed to the
Baithusians. In Maccoth, 5, <i>b</i>. Chagiga, 16 <i>b</i>. it is said that the Sadducees urged that a false witness should only then be executed
if the individual whom he had falsely accused had already been executed; in Tosifta
Sanhedrin, cap. vi. the same thing is ascribed to the Baithusians. According to Joma,
19 <i>b</i>. 53 <i>a</i>, the Sadducees would have it that the High Priest should put the incense on the fire
outside the Sanctuary on the great Day of Atonement, in Tosifta Joma, cap. 1, and
Jerusalem Joma, i. 5, this is also ascribed to the Baithusians. Comp. also 115, b.,
Megillath Taanith, cap. vi., with Tosifta Jadajim cap<span class="corr" id="xd31e2743" title="Not in source">.</span> ii. And 4. The Baithusians are constantly spoken of as heretics and false witnesses
(<i>comp. Jerusalem Rosh Ha-Shana</i>, ii, 1; <i>Babl. ibid.</i> 226), which is utterly at variance with the high character given to the Essenes even
by those who belonged to opposite sects.
</p>
<p>1587–1643.—Our learned countryman, Dr. Thomas Godwyn occupies the next position. In
his interesting and erudite volume, entitled <i>Moses and Aaron</i>: which was first published in London 1625, Godwyn devotes <i>the twelfth chapter of the first book</i> to the Essenes. The etymology of this name he takes to be the Syriac <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אסא‎</span> <i>to heal</i>, <i>to cure diseases</i>, and submits that they were called <span class="sc">Essenes</span> = <span class="trans" title="therapeutai"><span lang="grc" class="grek">θεραπευται</span></span> <i>physicians</i>, because they cultivated the study of medicine. His summary of their doctrines and
practices is made from Josephus’ description of them as well as from Philo’s reputed
account of <i>the Therapeutae</i> which has nothing to do with the Palestinian Essenes. Godwyn also gives a number
of supposed parallels between the doctrines and practices of <span class="pageNum" id="pb63">[<a href="#pb63">63</a>]</span>Essenism and Pythagorism. He does not attempt to account for these resemblances, nor
does he try to trace the origin of the brotherhood. He is, however, certain that they
existed in the time of Judas Maccabæus and “continued until the day of our Saviour
and after; for Philo and Josephus speak of them as living in their time.” He assigns
the following reasons for their not being mentioned in the New Testament 1. Their
being small in number. 2. “They were peaceable and quiet, not opposing any; and therefore
not so liable to reproof as the Pharisees and Sadducees, who opposed each other, and
both joined against Christ.” 3. They were passed over in silence in the New Testament
just “as the Rechabites in the Old Testament, of whom there is mention only once and
that obliquely, although their order continued about three hundred years, before this
testimony was given of them by the Prophet Jeremiah.” And 4. “Though the name of the
<i>Essenes</i> be not found in Scripture, yet we shall find in St. Paul’s Epistles many things reproved,
which were taught in the school of the Essenes. Of this nature was that advice given
unto Timothy:—‘<i>Drink no longer water, but use a little wine</i>.’ ( 1 Tim. v. 23 ). Again, ‘<i>Forbidding to marry, and commanding to abstain from meats is a doctrine of devils</i>’ ( 1 Tim. iv. 3 ); but especially <i>Colossians</i> ii. , in many passages the Apostle seemeth directly to point at them, ‘Let no man condemn
you in meat and drink’ (verse 16 ): ‘Let no man bear rule over you, by humbleness of mind and worshipping of angels’
(verse 18 ) ‘Why are ye subject to ordinances (<span class="trans" title="ti dogmatizesthe"><span lang="grc" class="grek">τί δογματίζεσθε</span></span> verse 20 )?’ The Apostle useth the word <span class="trans" title="dogmata"><span lang="grc" class="grek">δόγματα</span></span> which was applied by the Essenes to denote their <i>ordinances aphorisms</i> or <i>constitutions</i>. In the verse following he gives an instance of some particulars, ‘<i>Touch not, taste not, handle not</i>’ (ver. 21 ). Now the junior company of Essenes might not <i>touch</i> the seniors. And in their diet their taste was limited to bread, salt, water <span class="pageNum" id="pb64">[<a href="#pb64">64</a>]</span>and hyssop. And these ordinances they undertook <span class="trans" title="dia pothon"><span lang="grc" class="grek">διὰ πόθον</span></span> <span class="trans" title="sophias"><span lang="grc" class="grek">σοφίας</span></span> saith Philo, <i>for the love of wisdom</i>; but the Apostle concludeth (ver. 23 ) that these things had only <span class="trans" title="logon sophias"><span lang="grc" class="grek">λόγον σοφίας</span></span> a show of <i>wisdom</i>. And whereas Philo termeth the religion of the Essenes by the name of <span class="trans" title="therapeia"><span lang="grc" class="grek">θεράπεια</span></span> which word signifieth <i>religious worship</i>; the Apostle termeth in the same verse <span class="trans" title="ethilethrekeian"><span lang="grc" class="grek">εθιλεθρεκείαν</span></span> <i>voluntary religious worship</i> or <i>will worship</i>; yea, where he termeth their doctrine <span class="trans" title="patrōn philosophias"><span lang="grc" class="grek">πάτρων φιλοσοφιας</span></span> a kind of <i>philosophy received</i> from their forefathers by tradition; St. Paul biddeth them beware of <i>philosophy</i> (ver. 8 ).” I have given this extract in full because succeeding writers have with more or
less exactness based their opinion upon it. In animadverting upon it, I need only
refer to the former part of this Essay, where it will be seen that some of the things
here mentioned, are not peculiar to the Essenes, and others do not belong to them
at all, whilst the last quotation from Philo describes the <i>Therapeutae</i> and not the Essenes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2910src" href="#xd31e2910">78</a>
</p>
<p>1628–1678.—Next in point of time is Theophilus Gale, who gives us a description of
the Essenes in his famous work called <i>The Court of the Gentiles</i>, part ii. (Oxford, 1671), book ii. § 9, p. 146–156. As might be expected from this
learned writer, who wrote this elaborate work to demonstrate that “the original of
all human literature, both philology and philosophy, is from the Scriptures and the
Jewish Church,” he endeavours to prove that Pythagoras took the whole of his philosophic
system from the Essenes. “As for the origination of their name,” Gale tells us, “they
were called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חסדים‎</span> i.e. according to the Greek <span class="trans" title="katharoi"><span lang="grc" class="grek">καθαροὶ</span></span> and according to our English dialect <i>pure</i>. Now the origination or rise of these Essenes I conceive (by the best conjectures
I can make from antiquity), to be in or immediately after the Babylonian captivity
(though some make them later), and the occasion of their separation <span class="pageNum" id="pb65">[<a href="#pb65">65</a>]</span>and consociation seems this. Many of the carnal Jews defiling themselves either by
being too deeply plunged in worldly affairs, even to the neglect of their religion,
or, which was worse, by sensual compliances with their idolatrous lords, thereby to
secure their carnal interests, these <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חסדים‎</span> or Essenes, to preserve themselves from these common pollutions, separated and retired
themselves from the crowd of worldly affairs into an holy solitude, and private condition
of life; where they entered into a strict confederation or consociation to lead together
a collegiate devout life.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2936src" href="#xd31e2936">79</a> He then gives an epitome of their doctrines and practices, and finally endeavours
to shews that Pythagoras got his system from them. In doing this, Gale mixes up the
Therapeutae with the Essenes, and follows largely the description of Godwyn.
</p>
<p>1643–1724.—We then come to Dean Prideaux, who has a lengthy description of the Essenes
in <i>The Old and New Testaments Connected</i>, part ii. book v., which first appeared in London, 1717. The chief value of Prideaux’s
work on this subject consists in the fact, that he has given in English Philo and
Josephus on the Essenes, as well as the short notice from Pliny. In his own remarks,
which follow these extracts, he, in common with his predecessors, mixes up the Therapeutae
with the Essenes, and tries to repel the Romanists who adopted the assertion of Eusebius
(<i lang="la">Hist. Ecclesiast.</i> <i>lib.</i> ii. <i>c.</i> 17), that these Therapeutae or contemplative Essenes were Christian monks instituted
by St. Mark. He also endeavours to expose the folly of the Deists, who infer, from
the agreement between the Christian religion and the documents of the Essenes, that
Christ and his followers were no other than a sect branched out from that of the Essenes.
Among the accusations which the Dean brings against the Essenes for violating the
law of God, is the charge that they “absolutely condemned servitude which the holy
Scriptures of the <span class="pageNum" id="pb66">[<a href="#pb66">66</a>]</span>New Testament ( Philemon 9–21 ), as well as the Old, allow.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2956src" href="#xd31e2956">80</a> Instead of blaming them for repudiating slavery, we believe that the civilized world
in the present day will be unanimous in pronouncing it to have been one of the glorious
features of Essenism, anticipating the spirit of Christianity and the philanthropy
of the nineteenth century.
</p>
<p>1653–1723.—Basnage gives a very lengthy account of the Essenes in his History of the
Jews <i>lib.</i> ii. <i>chaps.</i> xii. xiii. Those who are acquainted with the writings of this learned Frenchman,
know that he could not write on anything without bringing together a mass of useful
information. He, however, mistook the character of the Essenes, as well as the value
of the documents upon which he relies. Preferring Philo’s account to that of Josephus,
though the latter lived amongst the Essenes, Basnage confounds the brotherhood with
the Therapeutae, and hence asserts that “they borrowed several superstitions from
the Egyptians, among whom they retired.” Through this, he is led to occupy by far
the greater part of his description with the needless discussion of the question “Whether
the Essenes from being Jews were converted to Christianity by St. Mark, and founded
a monastic life.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2967src" href="#xd31e2967">81</a>
</p>
<p>1692–1762.—Dr. Jennings’ chapter on the Essenes is simply a commentary on Godwyn’s
account. Jennings disputes some of the imaginary parallels between Essenism and Pythagorism
exhibited by Godwyn, and inclines to the opinion “that the Essenes begun a little
before the time of the Maccabees, when the faithful Jews were forced to fly from the
cruel persecutions of their enemies into deserts and caves, and by living in those
retreats, many of them being habituated to retirement, which thereby became most agreeable
to them, they chose to continue it, even when they might have appeared upon the public
<span class="pageNum" id="pb67">[<a href="#pb67">67</a>]</span>stage again, and accordingly formed themselves into recluses.” As to the difficulty
to account for “the absolute silence of the evangelical history concerning the Essenes,”
Jennings reiterates the remarks of Godwyn upon the subject.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2974src" href="#xd31e2974">82</a>
</p>
<p>In 1821, appeared in Berlin, Bellermann’s valuable little volume on the Essenes and
Therapeutae.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2979src" href="#xd31e2979">83</a> The author with characteristic German industry and perseverance, brought together
in this monograph the ancient documents on the Essenes. His critical acumen, however,
is not commensurate to his industry, and while his little volume will deservedly continue
to be a useful manual for the student who wishes to acquaint himself with what Philo,
Pliny, Josephus, Solinus, Porphyry, Epiphanius and Eusebius said upon this subject,
it is to be questioned whether Bellermann’s conclusions will be shared by many. He
is of opinion that “the Essenes and Baithusians are the same both in name and doctrine,”
and that “the Essenes have four other names in history besides their proper name,
viz.:—they are called, 1, <i>Therapeutae</i> by the Greek Alexandrians. 2. <i>Hiketeans</i> by Philo, in the superscription to the Treatise on contemplative life. 3. <i>Ossenes</i> or <i>Ossens</i>, by Epiphanius. And 4, <i>Baithusians</i> in the Talmud, and by several Rabbins. As this notion, which has been advanced by
De Rossi three centuries and a half ago, has already been refuted, it would be needless
to repeat the arguments here.
</p>
<p>1825.—Neander, whose first instalment of his gigantic Church History appeared in 1825,
now began to grapple with this mysterious brotherhood. In the introductory chapter
of this history, in which a description is given of the religious condition of the
world at the advent of Christ, he gives a very <span class="pageNum" id="pb68">[<a href="#pb68">68</a>]</span>brief but very pregnant sketch of the Essenes. With that deep penetration, which was
one of the chief characteristics of this sagacious critic, he repudiates the notion
that the Essenes originated under foreign influences, and maintains that “it is a
gross error to infer from the resemblance of certain religious phenomena the relationship
of which is to be traced to a common inward cause, inherent in the nature of the human
mind, that they have an external origin, having been copied from the other.” Hence,
he submits that Essenism arose out of the deeper religious meaning of the Old Testament,
that it afterwards adopted some of the old Oriental, Parsee, and Chaldean notions,
and that it had no Alexandrian elements. Neander moreover most justly cautions against
the accounts of Philo and Josephus, saying that they clothed the opinions of the Essenes
in a garb peculiarly Grecian, which we might rightly consider as not originally belonging
to them.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e2997src" href="#xd31e2997">84</a>
</p>
<p>1829.—The difficulty which perplexed Christian writers, arising from the fact that
the Essenes are not mentioned in the New Testament, did not affect Jewish writers,
although it is true that this name is also not to be found in the ancient Jewish writings.
For if it be granted that this appellation is a corruption of an Aramaic word, the
Essenes must be looked for in the Talmud and Midrashim, which are chiefly written
in Aramaic, under their original designation whatever that might be. The clue to it
must, of course, be the identity of the features ascribed to them by Philo and Josephus
and those ascribed in the ancient Jewish volumes to any order of Judaism. To this
task Rappaport, the corypheus of Jewish critics, betook himself. Knowing that the
Essenes were no distinct sect, in the strict sense of the word, but simply an order
of Judaism, and that there never was a rupture between them and the rest of the Jewish
community, Rappaport most <span class="pageNum" id="pb69">[<a href="#pb69">69</a>]</span>justly does not expect that they would be spoken of under a fixed denominational name.
He therefore rejects De Rossi’s notion that the Baithusians, so frequently denounced
in the Talmud and Midrashim, are the Essenes described by Philo and Josephus, and
sought to identify them by their peculiar practices, expecting to find that they would
be spoken of by different names. He soon found that what Philo and Josephus describe
as peculiarities of the Essenes tallies with what the Mishna, the Talmud, and the
Midrashim record of the <i>Chassidim</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חסדים‎</span>), and that they are most probably the so-called <i>old believers</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ותיקין‎</span>), who are also described in the Talmud as <i>the holy community in Jerusalem</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏קהלא קדישא דבירושלים‎</span>). He rightly recognised in them an intensified form of Pharisaism, and remarks that
what is said in the Mishna about the moderation observed in eating and drinking, the
great humility, endurance under sufferings, zeal for everything that is holy, community
of goods, &amp;c, refers to this holy community, or the Essenes. He also quotes the following
remark from the Midrash Coheleth, on Eccles. ix, 9 , about this holy community; “Rabi repeated from the traditions of the holy community
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏עדה קדושה‎</span>) ‘acquire a trade in connection with the study of the Scriptures, &amp;c.’—[Query] ‘Why
are they called holy community?’ [Reply] ‘Because they divided the day into three
divisions—devoting one-third to the study of the Scriptures, another to prayer, and
the third to work. Some say that they devoted the whole of the winter to studying
the Scriptures and the summer to work.’ ” He, too, was the first who pointed out that
the prayer which Josephus tells us the Essenes offered up at the rising of the sun,
is the national hymn of praise, which still constitutes a part of the Jewish daily
service, and is as follows:—
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">He in mercy causes His light to shine upon the earth and upon the inhabitants thereof;
and in His goodness unfailingly renews every day the work of creation. How numerous
are Thy works, O Lord! Thou hast made them all in wisdom; the earth is full of Thy
possessions. <span class="pageNum" id="pb70">[<a href="#pb70">70</a>]</span>O King, Thou only art the exalted one from everlasting, the praised and glorified
and extolled since the days of yore! Lord of the universe, in Thy great mercy have
mercy upon us! Lord our might, fortress of our strength, shield of our salvation,
defend us! O Lord, be Thou praised, Thou great in wisdom, who hast ordained and created
the rays of the sun: the Infinitely Good has formed a glorious testimony for His name.
He surrounded His majesty with luminaries<span class="corr" id="xd31e3031" title="Not in source">.</span> The chiefs of His heavenly hosts are holy beings; they glorify the Almighty; they
continually declare the glory of God and his holiness. Blessed be the Lord our God,
for the excellency of the works of Thy hands, and for the shining luminaries which
Thou hast. They shall glorify Thee for ever.
</p>
<p>God, the Lord of all created things, is praised and blessed in the mouths of all the
living. His power and goodness fill the universe; wisdom and intelligence are round
about Him. He exalts himself above the angels, and beams in glory upon his chariot-throne.
Interceding goodness and rectitude are before His throne, loving-kindness and mercy
before his majesty. Benign are the luminaries which our God has created. He has formed
them in wisdom, intelligence, and understanding; He has endowed them with power and
strength, to bear rule in the midst of the world. Filled with splendour and brightness,
their glory illuminates all the world; rejoicing in rising and joyous in setting they
perform with awe the will of their Creator. They give praise and glory to His name,
joy and song to the memory of His kingdom. He called the sun, and light rose; He saw
and shaped the form of the moon. Praise Him all ye heavenly hosts; ascribe glory and
majesty to Him ye seraphim, ophanim, and holy angels.</p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>These, as Rappaport rightly remarks, are some of the remains of the ancient prayer
used by the Essenes. It will be seen that these hymns of praise contain not only thanksgiving
for the renewal of the light, to which Josephus refers, but they also refer to the
mysterious cosmogony (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מעשה בראשית‎</span>) and theosophy (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מעשה מרכבה‎</span>), as well as to the angels which played such an important part among this brotherhood.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3044src" href="#xd31e3044">85</a>
</p>
<p>1835.—The difficulty of reading Rabbinical Hebrew in which Rappaport’s profound remarks
are written, must have prevented Gfrörer from seeing what this erudite Jewish critic
had written on the Essenes; for, although the second edition of vol. i. part 11 of
his <i>Critical History of Primitive Christianity</i>, containing an account of the Essenes, appeared in 1835, yet he positively states
“that the Essenes and the Therapeutae are the same sect and hold the same views” (p.
299). <span class="pageNum" id="pb71">[<a href="#pb71">71</a>]</span>According to him, the development of Essenism is as follows. In the third century
before Christ, the Jews in Alexandria formed societies according to the Pythagorean
model, and thus originated the sect called the Therapeutae, from these Egyptian Therapeutae
again Essenism developed itself in Palestine about 130 <span class="asc">B.C.</span> Hence Essenism is the channel through which the Alexandrian theosophy was first transplanted
into Palestinian soil. The reason why the Essenes kept their doctrines secret is that
the Palestinian priests were hostile to this foreign importation, and persecuted those
who received this contraband. Accordingly, the relationship of Pythagorism, Therapeutism
and Essenism, to use Gfrörer’s own figure, is that of grandmother, mother and daughter.
“So perfect is the agreement between the Therapeutae and the Essenes, that it even
extends to their names. For the word <span class="trans" title="Essains"><span lang="grc" class="grek">Ἐσσαῖνς</span></span> according to the most correct etymology, is derived from the Syro-Chaldaic verb <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אסא‎</span> which denotes <i>to cure</i>, <i>to nurse</i>, and hence is nothing but a literal translation of <span class="trans" title="therapeutēs"><span lang="grc" class="grek">θεραπευτὴς</span></span>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3080src" href="#xd31e3080">86</a>
</p>
<p>1843.—Similar in spirit is the elaborate article on the Essenes in <i lang="de">Ersch und Gruber’s Cyclopœdia</i>, written by Dähne, who maintains that “Essenism is the produce of the Jewish-Alexandrian
philosophy, and that it is only when viewed from this stand-point that the deviations
from the rest of their Jewish co-religionists, and their peculiar institutions, doctrines,
and precepts appear in the clearest light.” It is not surprising that holding such
an opinion Dähne should feel perplexed to account for the existence of this thoroughly
Jewish-Alexandrian order, as he makes the Essenes to be, in the very heart of Palestine.
All that he can say upon this subject is, that they somehow got there in the middle
of the second century before Christ. The affiliation of Essenism to the Jewish-Alexandrian
<span class="pageNum" id="pb72">[<a href="#pb72">72</a>]</span>philosophy brings it into most intimate relationship with Therapeutism, and necessarily
devolves upon Dähne to define this family connection which he does in the following
manner.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3090src" href="#xd31e3090">87</a> <span class="corr" id="xd31e3093" title="Not in source">“</span>The difference between the Therapeutae and the Essenes, both of whom are followers
of the Jewish-Alexandrian moral <span class="corr" id="xd31e3095" title="Source: philosphy">philosophy</span>, is that the former devoted themselves entirely to a contemplative life, whilst the
latter gave themselves more especially to a practical life. Hence though both rest
upon the same foundation, the Therapeutae gave themselves up absolutely to the highest
aim of man, as they marked it out, the contemplation of God; whilst the Essenes to
some extent voluntarily lingered in the outer court of the Holy of Holies, placed
themselves intentionally for the good of the brethren in more frequent contact with
the world than the requirements of nature demanded, thereby generously, but certainly
unphilosophically, temporarily retarding their own highest perfection and happiness.”
Like De Rossi, Bellermann, Gfrörer and others, Dähne derives the name from the Chaldee
<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אסא‎</span> <i>to heal</i>, and says “accordingly the term Essenes denotes <i>spiritual physicians</i>, or men who strive in the highest sense to lead back the spirit to its natural (i.e.
truly divine) character and activity.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3106src" href="#xd31e3106">88</a>
</p>
<p>1846.—A new epoch began in the history of the Essenes with the investigation of Frankel
on this subject, which <span class="pageNum" id="pb73">[<a href="#pb73">73</a>]</span>appeared in his <i lang="de">Zeitschrift für die religiözen Interesse des Judenthums</i>, 1846. Taking up the idea of Rappaport, that the Essenes must be looked for in the
body of the Jews and not as a separate sect, Frankel refers to the fact that, whilst
the <i>Assideans</i> = <i>Chassidim</i> are referred to in 1 Macc. ii. 24 ; 2 Macc. xiv. 6 , &amp;c., the <i>Perushim</i> = <i>Pharisees</i> are never mentioned, to show that no such marked and denominational divisions existed
at first in the community, and rightly remarks, that it “is only after a longer development
that sects appear in their separation, and sharply defined features, when that which
originally formed a united whole is now divided and parted into various branches.
And even this partition and separation only shew themselves to the analysing mind,
and especially when the analysis is conducted after a foreign fashion, as Josephus
has done it, who reduced the Jewish sects into Greek schools, and made the Essenes
correspond to the Pythagoreans. But in reality even these divisions flow one into
another, and do not stand in opposition to one another, but are simply to be distinguished
by their different shades of colour, and by the greater stringency or laxity with
which the same rules are regarded, so that they do not form separate sects, but some
individuals keep to these rules with greater anxiety, whilst others, though considering
them as binding, do not regard them as having such a wide application. Now in early
times there were only <i>Essenes</i> = <i>Chassidim</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חסדים‎</span>), the name of <i>Perush</i> = <i>Pharisee</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פרוש‎</span>) was not as yet known; it was only afterwards when in succeeding periods some became
more rigid in their manner of life and views of religion, that the name Pharisees
(<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏פרושים‎</span>) appears to denote the less strict Jews, whilst the others were in a special degree
denominated by the old, respectable appellation <i>Chassidim</i> = <i>Essenes</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חסדים‎</span>).” This, Frankel corroborates by showing most clearly that many of the vital principles
which Josephus describes as peculiar to Essenism, are at the very basis of <span class="pageNum" id="pb74">[<a href="#pb74">74</a>]</span>Pharisaism, and that the Essenes are frequently mentioned in the Mishna, Talmud, and
Midrashim by the names <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חסדים הראשונים‎</span> <i>the original Assideans</i> = <i>Chassidim</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חברים‎</span> <i>the associates</i>, <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏ותיקין‎</span> <i>those who have enfeebled their bodies through much study</i>; <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏דבירושלים‎</span> <i>the retired ones</i>; <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏צנועין קהלא קדישא‎</span> <i>the holy congregation in Jerusalem</i>; <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏טובלי שחרית‎</span> <i>hemerobaptists</i>. Frankel concluded his essay with the promise to return to this subject on some future
occasion.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3193src" href="#xd31e3193">89</a>
</p>
<p>1847.—Within twelve months of the publication of Frankel’s elaborate Essay, an article
appeared in the American Quarterly entitled <i>The Biblical Repository</i>. As there was not sufficient time for this German production to become known in the
New World, Mr. Hall, the writer of the article, could not avail himself of it, and
was therefore obliged to derive his information from the writings of Dr. Neander.
But though Mr. Hall has thrown no light on the Essenes, yet his reflections upon their
moral character and their connection with Christianity are so just, sensible and candid,
that we subjoin them to show that good Christians may honestly acknowledge the good
in Essenism without detracting from Christianity.
</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="first">“Let us give the Essene credit for all that he was as a worshipper of the true God,
and as a man striving after moral purity in a corrupt age. The Gospel that breathed
new life into the higher nature of man, can afford to allow all his virtues. We know
that the Spirit of Christ opens the eye to the excellencies of others. Truth rejoices
in truth, and as all truth is from the same source, the lustre of one development
can never be increased by hiding the glory of another. We would not enhance the necessity
of our Lord’s appearance by depreciating the moral condition of mankind at that period.
Those ascetic Jews deserve well of mankind for the light they gave out in a dark age.
We admire the humanity and justice of their principles; their disapproval of war and
slavery in the midst of a world lying in wickedness, and the noble example of industry,
frugality and moderation in the things of this life they set before all. We honour
their honest endeavours to combine the <i lang="la">vita contemplativa</i> and the <i lang="la">vita activa</i>,—to escape the bondage of the senses, to maintain the supremacy of the spirit, and
to unite themselves with the Highest. But in all these respects, they are only the
true children of monotheism, the legitimate offspring of the Jewish theocracy. They
could have sprung up nowhere else. In the phenomenon of the Essenes let us <span class="pageNum" id="pb75">[<a href="#pb75">75</a>]</span>therefore adore the provident wisdom of Jehovah, and recognize the secret working
of his love in carrying forward the great, eternal economy of salvation. They exerted
an influence on their age which helped to pave the way for the Christ. Conscience
spoke, and was spoken to, through them; and the dying sense of virtue was kept alive.
Thus were they stars which emitted an humble though useful light before, but grew
pale and became invisible after, the coming of the Sun of Righteousness.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3211src" href="#xd31e3211">90</a></p>
</blockquote><p>
</p>
<p>1852.—Though Ewald published the second edition of the fourth volume of his Jewish
History in 1852, when Frankel’s Essay had been six years before the literary world,
yet he manifests total ignorance of it in his account of the Essenes, contained in
this volume. Still, this profound and merciless critic, without having access to the
Jewish information gathered from the Talmud and Midrashim, saw that Essenism was no
Greek plant transplanted into Palestine, but like Pharisaism grew out of the Chassidim.
He remarks that “people who left the great community in order to lead a specially
holy life, with the permission and under the direction of the law, were to be found
in Israel from the remotest times, yet in its first form there were only the Nazarites,
of whom each one lived for himself; and in the second, the Rechabites combined themselves
already into a larger union; but now the whole conscience of the people itself, as
it were, departed into solitude with numerous Essenes. For it cannot be denied that
they, proceeding from the Chassidim, represent the direct and legitimate development
of Judaism in the form which became the ruling one since Ezra.” “Their new features
and endeavours merely consisted in their intensely earnest and rigorous application
of the demands of the law, as understood and interpreted since Ezra. Finding that
the rigorous and logical application of these laws was impossible in the great community,
especially in that community as regulated by the Pharisees, they preferred to congregate
and <span class="pageNum" id="pb76">[<a href="#pb76">76</a>]</span>live in solitude.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3218src" href="#xd31e3218">91</a> Very unfortunate is Ewald’s derivation of Essene from the Rabbinic <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חזן‎</span> <i>servant</i> (of God), and the assertion that this name was given to them because it was their
only desire to be <span class="trans" title="therapeutai theou"><span lang="grc" class="grek"><span class="corr" id="xd31e3229" title="Source: θεραπενταὶ">θεραπευταὶ</span> θεοῦ</span></span>.
</p>
<p>1853.—Nearly seven years had now elapsed since Frankel published his masterly Essay
on the Essenes, and promised to return to this subject at some future time. True to
his promise, he now gave another elaborate treatise, in which he substantiated, by
numerous quotations from the Talmud, his former conclusions, that the Essenes are
the offspring of Judaism, that they are nothing but stationary, or more correctly
speaking consequential Chassidim, that they were therefore not so far distant from
the Pharisees as to be regarded as a separate sect, but, on the contrary, that they
formed a branch of Pharisaism.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3242src" href="#xd31e3242">92</a>
</p>
<p>1856.—So convincing was Frankel’s Treatise, that Graetz, who published the third volume
of his masterly History of the Jews in 1856, in which he gives an elaborate account
of this brotherhood, remarks:<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3247src" href="#xd31e3247">93</a> “I completely accept these results about this sect being based upon critical investigation,
and shall only add a few supplementary points by way of illustration.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3250src" href="#xd31e3250">94</a> The additions consist of a very able analysis of Philo’s reputed Treatise entitled
<i lang="la">De Vita Contemplativa</i>, showing that it is spurious, and of an attempt to show that the Essenes were <i>perpetual Nazarites</i> (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נזירי עולם‎</span>). His remarks are as follow—“There were great masses of Nazarites in the <span class="pageNum" id="pb77">[<a href="#pb77">77</a>]</span>post-exile period (<i>Tosifta Nasir</i>, <i>c.</i> iv.; <i>Babbi Berachoth</i>, 48 <i>a</i>; 1 <i>Macc.</i> ii. 49; <i>Joseph. Antiq.</i> xviii. vi.), but they were of a different character to those of the Biblical period;
they were <i>Nazarites for the whole life</i> (<i>Nasir</i> 4 <i>a.</i>) The Mishna presupposed their existence; the magical in Nazaritism, which was connected
with the growing of the hair in the Nazarites of the Bible, gradually recedes into
the back ground or loses its significance altogether; whereas the Levitical, the guarding
against defilement, appears more and more in the foreground among the life-long Nazarites.
The Essenes then were such Nazarites as represented in private life the highest priestly
consecration. The connection between the Nazarites and Essenes has already been indicated
in obscure passages in the Talmud, that one consecrated himself to be a perpetual
Nazarite if he simply wished to be a Nazarite in order that he <span class="pageNum" id="pb78">[<a href="#pb78">78</a>]</span>might be able to preserve the secrets of disgraceful family circumstances. (<i>Tosifta Nasir</i>, <i>b.</i> i. 6; <i>Kidushim</i> 71 <i>a.</i>)<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3389src" href="#xd31e3389">95</a>
</p>
<p>1857.—The learned historian Jost, who published the first volume of his History of
Judaism in 1857, was also perfectly convinced by the results of Frankel’s researches,
and made them the basis of his excellent description of the Essenes, in which he maintains
that they grew out of Pharisaism or from the ancient <i>Chassidim</i>. “The Essenes,” he submits, “are exactly the same that the other Rabbis wished to
be who endeavoured to practise the Levitical law of purity, as leading to higher consecration.
They have neither another creed nor another law, but simply institutions peculiar
to this brotherhood, and endeavour to reach the highest consecration by their manner
of life, in defining the different stages, according to preliminary exercises and
certain years of preparation. Their views and tenets are therefore also to be found
in the utterances of the learned and the Rabbis who did not enter their order, so
that they did not look upon the Essenes as opponents or apostates, but, on the contrary,
as holding the same opinions with increased claims and some fewer enjoyments, whom
many out of their own midst joined, and who were called <i>Chassidim</i> or <i>Zenuim</i>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3400src" href="#xd31e3400">96</a>
</p>
<p>1857.—The comparatively few and unessential deviations from Judaism to be found in
Essenism were, however, more than Herzfeld could tolerate, without characterising
the innovators as heretics and smugglers of contraband opinions. Dissatisfied with
the modern researches of Frankel and Graetz on this subject, this learned historian,
and chief Rabbi of Brunswick, returned to the old notion of De Rossi, that the Essenes
of Josephus and Philo are identical with the Baithusians mentioned in the Talmud.
Still he thinks that De Rossi’s <span class="pageNum" id="pb79">[<a href="#pb79">79</a>]</span>opinion “must be better proved than he had done it,” and therefore remarks—“first
of all, seeing that the prefixed <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בית‎</span> denotes school or sect in the appellations Beth-Shammai, Beth-Hillel; that <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בית הכותים‎</span> in Tosifta Helem ii. b, and <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בי כותאי‎</span> in Chullin 6 a, denotes <i>the sect</i> or <i>the land</i> of Cuttim; and then that <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בית סין‎</span> stands twice Tosifta Succa, cap. iii., and Tosifta Menachoth cap. x. for Baithusians,
can it mean anything else than <i>house</i> or <i>sect of Essenes</i>? When <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אסי‎</span> <i>physician</i> became the name of a sect, an Essene could not so well be called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אסי‎</span> without ambiguity; he was therefore described as one of <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בית אסי‎</span>.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3440src" href="#xd31e3440">97</a> Thus much for the origin of the name, and now let us hear Dr. Herzfeld’s theory about
the brotherhood itself. It is simply this<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3487src" href="#xd31e3487">98</a>—“A Jew, who became acquainted with the allegorical exegesis prevalent among the Alexandrian
Jews, and with its mother the Greek wisdom, but who, like Pythagoras, Plato and Herodotus,
had also found <span class="pageNum" id="pb80">[<a href="#pb80">80</a>]</span>an opportunity to learn some things from Egyptian priests, conceived and carried out
the plan, eclectically to form from it and from Judaism a speculative and ascetic
system, as well as to organise, according to its model, a sect from the Jewish ascetics.”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3502src" href="#xd31e3502">99</a> This Alexandrianized Palestinian Jew founded the order of the Essenes in Palestine
about 230 <span class="asc">B.C.</span>
</p>
<p>1857.—Another effort was made in this year to explain the origin of this mysterious
brotherhood. Professor Hilgenfeld of Jena, who maintains their genuine Jewish origin,
starts the notion that the Essenes belonged to the Apocalytical school, and that they
must be regarded as the successors of the ancient prophets, and as constituting the
prophetic school. It is only when we view them from this stand point that their precepts
and practices can be understood, and that the high antiquity ascribed to them by Josephus
(Antiq. xviii. 1, 2) and Pliny (Hist. Nat. v. 17), can be comprehended. This he moreover
assures us gives the clue to the explanation of their name. The Hebrew prophets were
also called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חזים‎</span> <i>seers</i>, which, being in the Aramaic pronunciation <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חזין‎</span>, easily gave rise through Greek change of vowels to the name <span class="trans" title="Essaiou, Essēnoi"><span lang="grc" class="grek">Ἐσσαῖου, Ἐσσηνοί</span></span>. Hilgenfeld manifests an almost inexcusable ignorance of the labours of Frankel and
Graetz on the Essenes.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3527src" href="#xd31e3527">100</a>
</p>
<p>1860.—A necessarily brief but interesting article on the Essenes, written by the able
Mr. Westcott, appeared in Smith’s Dictionary of the Bible. The writer wisely availed
himself of the labours of Frankel and Jost, and properly traced the origin of the
brotherhood to the Chassidim. His fear, however, lest any shining virtues in the Essenes
might be thought by some to pale some of the brightness of the Sun of Righteousness,
prevented him from appreciating the true <span class="pageNum" id="pb81">[<a href="#pb81">81</a>]</span>character of this order, as well as from seeing that they paved the way to Christianity.
</p>
<p>1863.—Graetz again, in the second edition of the third volume of his History of the
Jews, in which he has an additional chapter on the Rise and Progress of Christianity,
goes to the other extreme, and maintains that <span class="corr" id="xd31e3537" title="Not in source">“</span>Jesus simply appropriated to himself the essential features of Essenism,”<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3539src" href="#xd31e3539">101</a> and that primitive Christianity was nothing but an offshoot from Essenism.
</p>
<p>1862.—Of the article on the Essenes in Dr. Alexander’s valuable edition of Kitto’s
Cyclopædia of Biblical Literature, being written by me, I can do no more than say
that it embodies the substance of this Essay.
</p>
<p>1863.—The description of the Essenes in the new edition of Dean Milman’s History of
the Jews, gives a very imperfect idea both of the development and morality of this
brotherhood.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3545src" href="#xd31e3545">102</a> The learned Dean seems to be wholly unacquainted with the researches of Frankel and
Graetz on this subject. He, however, rightly rejects the notion that Essenism had
its origin in Pythagorism.
</p>
<hr class="tb"><p>
</p>
<p>1847.—After the above was printed, I found a notice of the Essenes in Hirschfeld’s
work on the <i>Hagadic Exegesis</i>, in which he submits that the name Essene may be derived from the Greek <span class="trans" title="ēthos"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἦθος</span></span> <i>manners</i>, <i>morality</i>, <i>virtue</i>, that though the Essenes had several things in common with the Therapeutae, yet there
was a great difference between the two sects, and that the former rested more on the
Bible and on Judaism. Still he affirms that “some Neo-Platonic, Pythagorean and Persian
ideas found their way among the Essenes, <span class="pageNum" id="pb82">[<a href="#pb82">82</a>]</span>and brought with them some practices and institutions which this brotherhood mixed
up with the Jewish views of religion, and amongst which are to be classed their extension
of the laws of purification, &amp;c.” Hirschfeld, moreover, maintains that, “like the
Alexandrians, but only from a different standpoint, the Essenes aimed to reconcile
religion with science.” As this opinion has already been discussed in this Essay,
it is needless to repeat the objections against it.<a class="noteRef" id="xd31e3571src" href="#xd31e3571">103</a>

<div class="fndiv" id="xd31e202">
<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd31e202src">1</a></span> According to tradition there were four degrees of purity. 1. The ordinary purity required
of every worshipper in the temple (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏טהרת חולין‎</span>). 2. The higher degree of purity necessary for eating of the heave-offering (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏טהרת תרומה‎</span>). 3. The still higher degree requisite for partaking of the sacrifices (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏טהרת הקודש‎</span>). And 4. The degree of purity required of those who sprinkle the water absolving
from sin (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏טהרת חטאת‎</span>). Each degree of purity required a greater separation from the impurities described
in Leviticus xi, 24 – xv, 28 . These impure subjects were termed <i>the fathers of impurity</i>; that which was touched by them was designated <i>the first generation of impurity</i>; what was touched by this again, was called <i>the second generation of impurity</i>; and so on. Now, heave-offerings—the second degree of holiness—became impure when
touched by <i>the third generation</i>; the flesh of sacrifices—the third degree of holiness—when coming in contact with
the fourth generation; and so on. These degrees of purity had even to be separated
from each other; because the lower degree was, in respect to the higher one, regarded
as impure, and any one who lived according to a higher degree of purity became impure
by touching one who lived according to a lower degree, and could only regain his purity
by lustrations (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏טבילה‎</span>). The first degree was obligatory upon every one, the other grades were voluntary.
Before partaking of the heave-offering, the washing of hands was required; and before
eating of the flesh of sacrifices, immersion of the whole body was required—<i>Comp. Babylonian Talmud, Tract Chagiga</i>, 18 <i>b</i>.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd31e202src" title="Return to note 1 in text.">↑</a></p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd31e1601src">21</a></span> Josephus, who also mentions this fact, distinctly says that their not offering sacrifices
in the temple is owing to the different degree of holiness which they practised. (<i lang="la">Vide infra</i> <i>p.</i> 228.) From the repeated declarations in the Bible, that a life of uniform obedience
and faithful service is far more acceptable to God than the cattle of a thousand hills
( 1 Sam. xv. 22 ; Ps. xl. 7 ; l. 7–14 ; li. 17 ; Prov. xxxi. 3 ; Isa. i. 11 , 17 ; lxv. 3 ; Jer. vii. 21–23 ; Hos. vi. 6 ; xiv. 3 ; Micah, vi. 6–8 ), the Essenes could easily be reconciled to their abstaining from offering animal
sacrifices, and would be led to attach infinitely greater importance to the presenting
of their bodies a living sacrifice, holy and acceptable to God. (Comp. also Rom. xii. 1 ). This circumstance led Petitius to the conclusion that Herod, who was friendly to
the Essenes in consequence of the favorable prophecy about him uttered by the Essene
Menahem (<i lang="la">vide infra</i> <i>p.</i> 50), employed them to translate the Prophets and the Psalms into Greek, and that
they availed themselves of the opportunity to introduce their tenets and rites into
this version, now called the Septuagint. Thus, for instance, when David said “Sacrifice
and burnt offering thou didst not desire, mine ears hast thou opened” ( Ps. xl. 6 ), the Essenes rendered it “Sacrifice and burnt offering thou dost not desire, but
a body hast thou prepared me,” interpolating three of their tenets. 1. They made the
Prophet speak absolutely, as if God had entirely rejected sacrifices because they
would offer him none. 2. By dropping the words, “<i>mine ears hast thou opened</i>,” they showed their disapprobation of slavery. (Comp. Exod. xxi ). And 3, by substituting “<i>a body</i> hast thou prepared me,” they understood the college of devout Essenes, who met together
as a body, and whom God appointed instead of sacrifice. Comp. Basnage, History of
the Jews, English translation. London, 1708, p. 128.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd31e1601src" title="Return to note 21 in text.">↑</a></p>

with those who did not live according to the same rules, was the principal cause of
their living separately. (<i>Vide supra</i> <i>p.</i> 7, <i>note</i> 1.) Philo, however, states the first reason because the Greeks, for whom he wrote,
understood it better than the second, which is so peculiarly Jewish in its character.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd31e1666src" title="Return to note 22 in text.">↑</a></p>

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd31e1880src">37</a></span> The Mosaic law regards conjugal intercourse as polluting, and enjoins bathing after
it ( Levit<span class="corr" id="xd31e1884" title="Not in source">.</span> xv. 18 .) Hence, when the children of Israel had to sanctify themselves in the highest degree,
so as to be fit to receive the law from Mount Sinai, they were commanded not to approach
their wives ( Exod. xix. 15 ). Hence, also, those who had the charge of the shew-bread polluted the sacred loaves
by going to their wives ( 1 Sam. xxi. 4 ). And hence the remark of the Apostle Paul, that in order to give themselves to fasting
and prayer, man and wife may keep aloof from each other by mutual consent ( 1 Cor. vii. 5 ). The same laws obtained among all nations of antiquity. Thus, among the Egyptians,
Babylonians, Arabians, Greeks and Romans, both man and wife had to bathe after connubial
intercourse (<i>Herod.</i><span class="corr" id="xd31e1897" title="Not in source">,</span> i. 198). No one was allowed to go after it to the temple without bathing (<i>Herod.</i><span class="corr" id="xd31e1901" title="Not in source">,</span> ii. 64; <i>Suet. Aug.</i> xciv. 5; <i>Pers.</i> ii. 50, <i>&amp;c.</i>); and the priests had to abstain from approaching their wives when they were ministering
in holy things (<i lang="la">Porphyrius, de Abstinentia</i>, lib. ii. 50; iv. 7; <i lang="la">Plutarch. Sympos.</i> iii. 6; <i>Tibul.</i> lib. ii. Eleg. 1, 11, <i>&amp;c.</i>; <i lang="la">Ovid. Metam.</i> x. 434, <i>&amp;c.</i>) Now, as the Essenes strove to be in a perpetual state of sanctification, regarded
their refectory as a sanctuary and their meals as sacraments, and most anxiously avoided
contact with every thing that defiled, they had of necessity to extend these Mosaic
laws, which enjoin abstinence from connubial intercourse as a means of sanctification,
and which regard those who indulged in it as defiled, to the whole course of their
life; and they had therefore to be celibates. This extension of the Mosaic law was
moreover deemed desirable in consequence of the general conviction which the Jews
entertained, in common with other nations, that no woman remains faithful to her husband,
and that they all defile the bed of marriage. Philo, in the passage before us, and
Josephus, as we shall see afterwards (<i lang="la">vide infra</i> <i>p.</i> 41, § 2), only give the latter reason, to suit their Greek readers who could both

<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd31e2172src">53</a></span> These ancient books on magical cures and exorcisms were the reputed works of Solomon,
who, according to the Talmud as well as the Byzantine and Arabian writers, composed
treatises on miraculous cures and driving out evil spirits. (<i>Comp. Pesachim</i> 56 <i>a</i>; <i>Fabricius</i>, <i lang="la">Codex pseudepigraphus Vet. Test.</i> <i>p.</i> 1042, <i>&amp;c.</i>; <i>Weil</i>, <i lang="de"><span class="corr" id="xd31e2191" title="Source: Bibliblische">Biblische</span> Legenden der Muselmänner</i>, <i>p.</i> 225–279). Josephus tells <span class="pageNum" id="pb45n">[<a href="#pb45n">45</a>]</span>us elsewhere that some of these Solomonic productions still existed in his own days,
and that he had actually seen demons driven out and people cured by their aid. (<i>Comp. Antiq.</i> book viii. chap. ii. § 5.) This account most strikingly illustrates what Christ says
in Matth. xii. 27 .&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd31e2172src" title="Return to note 53 in text.">↑</a></p>

<div class="fndiv" id="xd31e2210">
<p class="footnote"><span class="fnlabel"><a class="noteRef" href="#xd31e2210src">54</a></span> This custom has its origin in the extension of a Mosaic law. The hosts of the Lord
are commanded in Deut. xxiii 13, 15 , to have spades among the martial instruments in order to bury therewith their excrements
without the camp, and thus to keep themselves pure from every pollution, and to be
a holy camp, because the Holy One of Israel dwells in the midst thereof. Now as the
Essenes strove to be, in a pre-eminent sense, the spiritual hosts of the Lord, every
one of them was obliged to have this spade in order to guard their sacred camp from
defilement. For this reason the apron was also given to cover their nakedness in their
numerous baptisms, and thus to keep their thoughts from dwelling upon anything which
might lead to impurity; whilst the white garment was the symbol of their holiness.
This, however, was not peculiar to the Essenes, as the Talmud tells us that when any
one applied to become a member of the Pharisaic order (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏חבר‎</span>), he had to pass through a noviciate of twelve months, at the expiration of which
he received a sort of garment called <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏כנפים‎</span>, and having duly qualified himself in this stage, he was afterwards admitted to the
holier lustrations (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מקבלין לכנסּים ואחר כד מקבלין לטהרות‎</span>). (<i>Comp. Tosifta Demai e.</i> 11; <i>Jerusalem Demai</i> ii. 3; <i>Babylonian Becharoth</i> 30, 6).&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd31e2210src" title="Return to note 54 in text.">↑</a></p>

took, is that, being bound by an oath to observe the practices of the brotherhood,
he could only accept meals from those who lived according to the highest degree of
purity (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏על טהרת חטאת‎</span>), and who, as a matter of course, kept their meals according to this degree. But
as such a mode of life was of very uncommon occurrence, the excommunicated Essene
was obliged to live on herbs or vegetables which he had to pluck himself; for, according
to the Talmud, plants are only then considered unclean when they are <i>cut off</i> and water is poured upon them (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏משהוכשרו לקבל טומאה משנתלשו‎</span>). As for Josephus’ saying that he died a miserable death, and that he could only
eat <i>grass</i> (<span class="trans" title="poiēphagōn"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ποιηφάγων</span></span>), this is simply another instance of his exaggerating and colouring his subject.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd31e2259src" title="Return to note 59 in text.">↑</a></p>

of <i>eternal counsels</i> and <i>predestination</i> spoken of in the Bible. Indeed, elsewhere Josephus tells us distinctly that “the
doctrine of the Essenes delights to leave all things to God” (<i lang="la">vide infra</i> <i>p.</i> 52); so that that which is in the one case ascribed to <i>fate</i>, is in the other ascribed to <i>God</i>.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd31e2360src" title="Return to note 66 in text.">↑</a></p>

Aber sie trugen zugleich einen andern Charakter, als <span class="pageNum" id="pb77n">[<a href="#pb77n">77</a>]</span>die der biblischen Zeit: sie waren Nasiräer fürs ganze Leben <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נזיר עולם‎</span> (<i>Nasir</i> 4 <i>a</i>). Die Mischna setzt das Vorhandensein solcher ohne Weiteres voraus, und das Magische
an dem Nasiräerthum, das sich bei den biblischen Nasiräern an den Haarwuchs knüpfte,
tritt immer mehr zurück, oder hat vielmehr gar keine Bedeutung mehr. <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏נזיר עולם הכביד שערו מיקל בשער‎</span> (das.). Hingegen tritt bei den lebenslänglichen Nasiräern das Levitische, die Hut
vor Verunreinigung, immer mehr in den Vordergrund (das.)<span class="corr" id="xd31e3284" title="Not in source">.</span> Die Essäer werden also solche Nasiräer gewesen sein, welche in ihrem Privatleben
die höchste <span class="corr" id="xd31e3286" title="Source: priesterilische">priesterliche</span> Weihe darstellen wollten. Den Zusammenhang zwischen Nasiräern and Essäern deutet
schon eine dunkle talmudische Stelle an, dass Jemand sich dadurch schon dem vollständigen
Nasireat weiht, wenn er auch nur insofern Nasiräer sein will, um die Geheimnisse entehrender
Familienverhältnisse bewahren zu können: <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏הריני נזיר אם לא אגלה משפחות הרי זו נזיר ולא יגלה משפחות‎</span> (<i>Tosifta Nasir</i> <i>c.</i> 1 <i>b</i> <i>Kiduschim</i> 71 <i>a</i>). Die Erklärung dieser Stelle durch den Essenismus hat schon Edeles (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מהרש״א‎</span>) in seinem Agadacommentar z. St. geahnt. Diesen Zusammenhang zwischen Nasiräerthum
und Essenismus haben Epiphanius und die arabischen Schriftsteller Makrisi und Abulfarag’
geahnt; wenn auch Epiphanius die <span class="trans" title="Nazaraioi"><span lang="grc" class="grek">Ναζαραῖοι</span></span> von den <span class="trans" title="Ossēnoi"><span lang="grc" class="grek">Ὀσσηνοί</span></span> unterscheidet, so sind die Eigenheiten, die er von den Erstern berichtet, doch ganz
essäisch. Ebenso hat Makrisi die Essäer in drei Secten zerspalten, in die Täufer (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מנטהרון‎</span> = <span class="trans" title="hēmerobaptistai"><span lang="grc" class="grek">ἡμεροβαπτισταί</span></span>), die Essäer (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אסאניון‎</span>) und in die Nasiräer (<span lang="he" class="hebr">‏מתחשפון‎</span>) (in <i>de Sacy Chrestomathie Arabe</i> Ausgabe von 1806, arabischer Theil 172 und <i>tome</i> ii, 218). Das arabische Makkabäerbuch bezeichnet die Essäer durch Chassidäer (c.
xxv); in Josippon fehlen an der Stelle, wo er von den drei Secten spricht, gerade
die Essäer (iv, 6, Breithaupt) Die Identität von Nasiräern, Essäern und Assidäern
wird also von vielen Seiten bestätigt. Auch aus Josephus’ Angabe, die Essäer hätten
eigne Bücher gehabt (jüd. Kr. ii, 8, 7), lässt sich ihre Identität mit den Assidäern
erweisen. Im Talmud (Jeruschalmi Barachot, Ende) wird aus einem Buchs der Chassidäer
der Satz mitgetheilt: “Verlässt du sie einen Tag, so verlässt sie dich zwei Tage”:

dies nur besser begründet werden, als von ihm geschehen ist. Ich bemerke zu dem Ende
erstens, dass wie das vorgesetzte <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בית‎</span> auch in den Benennungen Bet-Schammaj, Bet-Hillel Schule oder Fraction bedeutet, so
<i>Tosifta Kelim</i> ii, 6 <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בית הכותים‎</span>, <i>Chulin</i> 6, <i>a</i> <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בי כותאי‎</span> für die Sekte oder das Land der Cutim vorkommt; sodann dass <i>Tosifta Succa</i>, K. iii zweimal und <i>Tosifta Menachot</i> K. z. für Baitusim <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בית סין‎</span> stehet: kann dies wohl etwas Anderes als Haus, Sekte der Essener bedeuten? Als <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אסי‎</span> (Arzt) Sektenname wurde, konnte man den Essäer nicht gut mehr schlechthin <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אסי‎</span> nennen, ohne undeutlich zu werden, man umschrieb ihn daher wohl als Einen vom <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בית אסי‎</span>, bildete danach auch mit Zugrundelegung der Form Essener, das nachgewiesene <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏בית סין‎</span> and zog dann Jenes zusammen, um den einzelnen Essäer zu bezeichnen, gab aber dieser
Form den u-Laut, entweder nachdem man das syrische Wort <span lang="he" class="hebr">‏אסי‎</span> zuweilen nach syrischer Weise <i>ôsseh</i>, also dunkel ausgesprochen hatte, woher die <span class="corr" id="xd31e3483" title="Source: Ausprache">Aussprache</span> Ossener bei Epiphanius herrühren mag, oder was mir noch wahrscheinlicher ist, indem

Juden aufblühenden allegorischen Exegese und mit deren Erzeugerin, der griechischen
Weisheit, bekannt geworden war, daneben aber auch Gelegenheit gefunden hatte, von
ägyptischen Priestern Manches zu lernen, wie Pythagoras selbst, Platon und Herodot,
den Plan gefasst und ausgeführt habe, eklektisch hieraus und aus dem Judenthume ein
speculatives und asketisches System sowie nach demselben aus judäischen Asketen eine
Sekte zu bilden. Dass es an Solchen nicht gefehlt habe, verbürgt das Vorkommen von
Nasiräern, z. B. nach <i>Tosifta Nasir</i> K. iv unter Schimon dem Gerechten, ferner 1 Mack. iii, 49, und von ihrer 300 auf
einmal unter Schimon ben Schatach nach <i>Nasir jer.</i> v, 3. Dass er aber nicht mit jüdischen Asketen in <span class="corr" id="xd31e3493" title="Source: Aegypten">Ägypten</span> diesen Versuch machte, geschah vielleicht, weil es damals dort noch an solchen Asketen
<span class="corr" id="xd31e3496" title="Source: fehate">fehlte</span>, oder weil er selbst aus Judäa gebürtig sein mochte.&nbsp;<a class="fnarrow" href="#xd31e3487src" title="Return to note 98 in text.">↑</a></p>

the terms of the trademark license, including paying royalties for use
of the Project Gutenberg trademark. If you do not charge anything for

easy. You may use this eBook for nearly any purpose such as creation

To protect the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting the free
distribution of electronic works, by using or distributing this work
(or any other work associated in any way with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221;), you agree to comply with all the terms of the Full
Project Gutenberg&#8482; License available with this file or online at
www.gutenberg.org/license.

Section 1. General Terms of Use and Redistributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.A. By reading or using any part of this Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic work, you indicate that you have read, understand, agree to
and accept all the terms of this license and intellectual property
(trademark/copyright) agreement. If you do not agree to abide by all
the terms of this agreement, you must cease using and return or
destroy all copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in your
possession. If you paid a fee for obtaining a copy of or access to a
Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work and you do not agree to be bound
by the terms of this agreement, you may obtain a refund from the person
or entity to whom you paid the fee as set forth in paragraph 1.E.8.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.B. &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is a registered trademark. It may only be
used on or associated in any way with an electronic work by people who
agree to be bound by the terms of this agreement. There are a few
things that you can do with most Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
even without complying with the full terms of this agreement. See
paragraph 1.C below. There are a lot of things you can do with Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works if you follow the terms of this
agreement and help preserve free future access to Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works. See paragraph 1.E below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.C. The Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation (&#8220;the
Foundation&#8221; or PGLAF), owns a compilation copyright in the collection
of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works. Nearly all the individual
works in the collection are in the public domain in the United
States. If an individual work is unprotected by copyright law in the
United States and you are located in the United States, we do not
claim a right to prevent you from copying, distributing, performing,
displaying or creating derivative works based on the work as long as
all references to Project Gutenberg are removed. Of course, we hope
that you will support the Project Gutenberg&#8482; mission of promoting
free access to electronic works by freely sharing Project Gutenberg&#8482;
works in compliance with the terms of this agreement for keeping the
Project Gutenberg&#8482; name associated with the work. You can easily
comply with the terms of this agreement by keeping this work in the
same format with its attached full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License when
you share it without charge with others.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.D. The copyright laws of the place where you are located also govern
what you can do with this work. Copyright laws in most countries are
in a constant state of change. If you are outside the United States,
check the laws of your country in addition to the terms of this
agreement before downloading, copying, displaying, performing,
distributing or creating derivative works based on this work or any
other Project Gutenberg&#8482; work. The Foundation makes no
representations concerning the copyright status of any work in any
country other than the United States.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E. Unless you have removed all references to Project Gutenberg:
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.1. The following sentence, with active links to, or other
immediate access to, the full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License must appear
prominently whenever any copy of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work (any work
on which the phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; appears, or with which the
phrase &#8220;Project Gutenberg&#8221; is associated) is accessed, displayed,
performed, viewed, copied or distributed:
</div>

<blockquote>
  <div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
    This eBook is for the use of anyone anywhere in the United States and most
    other parts of the world at no cost and with almost no restrictions
    whatsoever. You may copy it, give it away or re-use it under the terms
    of the Project Gutenberg License included with this eBook or online
    at <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>. If you
    are not located in the United States, you will have to check the laws
    of the country where you are located before using this eBook.
  </div>
</blockquote>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.2. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is
derived from texts not protected by U.S. copyright law (does not
contain a notice indicating that it is posted with permission of the
copyright holder), the work can be copied and distributed to anyone in
the United States without paying any fees or charges. If you are
redistributing or providing access to a work with the phrase &#8220;Project
Gutenberg&#8221; associated with or appearing on the work, you must comply
either with the requirements of paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 or
obtain permission for the use of the work and the Project Gutenberg&#8482;
trademark as set forth in paragraphs 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.3. If an individual Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work is posted
with the permission of the copyright holder, your use and distribution
must comply with both paragraphs 1.E.1 through 1.E.7 and any
additional terms imposed by the copyright holder. Additional terms
will be linked to the Project Gutenberg&#8482; License for all works
posted with the permission of the copyright holder found at the
beginning of this work.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.4. Do not unlink or detach or remove the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
License terms from this work, or any files containing a part of this
work or any other work associated with Project Gutenberg&#8482;.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.5. Do not copy, display, perform, distribute or redistribute this
electronic work, or any part of this electronic work, without
prominently displaying the sentence set forth in paragraph 1.E.1 with
active links or immediate access to the full terms of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; License.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.6. You may convert to and distribute this work in any binary,
compressed, marked up, nonproprietary or proprietary form, including
any word processing or hypertext form. However, if you provide access
to or distribute copies of a Project Gutenberg&#8482; work in a format
other than &#8220;Plain Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other format used in the official
version posted on the official Project Gutenberg&#8482; website
(www.gutenberg.org), you must, at no additional cost, fee or expense
to the user, provide a copy, a means of exporting a copy, or a means
of obtaining a copy upon request, of the work in its original &#8220;Plain
Vanilla ASCII&#8221; or other form. Any alternate format must include the
full Project Gutenberg&#8482; License as specified in paragraph 1.E.1.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.7. Do not charge a fee for access to, viewing, displaying,

unless you comply with paragraph 1.E.8 or 1.E.9.

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.E.8. You may charge a reasonable fee for copies of or providing
access to or distributing Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
provided that:
</div>

<div style='margin-left:0.7em;'>
    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You pay a royalty fee of 20% of the gross profits you derive from
        the use of Project Gutenberg&#8482; works calculated using the method
        you already use to calculate your applicable taxes. The fee is owed
        to the owner of the Project Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, but he has
        agreed to donate royalties under this paragraph to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation. Royalty payments must be paid
        within 60 days following each date on which you prepare (or are
        legally required to prepare) your periodic tax returns. Royalty
        payments should be clearly marked as such and sent to the Project
        Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation at the address specified in
        Section 4, &#8220;Information about donations to the Project Gutenberg

        &#8226; You provide a full refund of any money paid by a user who notifies
        you in writing (or by e-mail) within 30 days of receipt that s/he
        does not agree to the terms of the full Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        License. You must require such a user to return or destroy all
        copies of the works possessed in a physical medium and discontinue
        all use of and all access to other copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
        works.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>
        &#8226; You provide, in accordance with paragraph 1.F.3, a full refund of
        any money paid for a work or a replacement copy, if a defect in the
        electronic work is discovered and reported to you within 90 days of
        receipt of the work.
    </div>

    <div style='text-indent:-0.7em'>

forth in Section 3 below.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain &#8220;Defects,&#8221; such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.2. LIMITED WARRANTY, DISCLAIMER OF DAMAGES - Except for the &#8220;Right
of Replacement or Refund&#8221; described in paragraph 1.F.3, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation, the owner of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; trademark, and any other party distributing a Project
Gutenberg&#8482; electronic work under this agreement, disclaim all
liability to you for damages, costs and expenses, including legal
fees. YOU AGREE THAT YOU HAVE NO REMEDIES FOR NEGLIGENCE, STRICT
LIABILITY, BREACH OF WARRANTY OR BREACH OF CONTRACT EXCEPT THOSE
PROVIDED IN PARAGRAPH 1.F.3. YOU AGREE THAT THE FOUNDATION, THE
TRADEMARK OWNER, AND ANY DISTRIBUTOR UNDER THIS AGREEMENT WILL NOT BE
LIABLE TO YOU FOR ACTUAL, DIRECT, INDIRECT, CONSEQUENTIAL, PUNITIVE OR
INCIDENTAL DAMAGES EVEN IF YOU GIVE NOTICE OF THE POSSIBILITY OF SUCH
DAMAGE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.3. LIMITED RIGHT OF REPLACEMENT OR REFUND - If you discover a
defect in this electronic work within 90 days of receiving it, you can
receive a refund of the money (if any) you paid for it by sending a
written explanation to the person you received the work from. If you
received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person
or entity providing it to you may choose to give you a second
opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.4. Except for the limited right of replacement or refund set forth
in paragraph 1.F.3, this work is provided to you &#8216;AS-IS&#8217;, WITH NO
OTHER WARRANTIES OF ANY KIND, EXPRESS OR IMPLIED, INCLUDING BUT NOT
LIMITED TO WARRANTIES OF MERCHANTABILITY OR FITNESS FOR ANY PURPOSE.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.5. Some states do not allow disclaimers of certain implied
warranties or the exclusion or limitation of certain types of
damages. If any disclaimer or limitation set forth in this agreement
violates the law of the state applicable to this agreement, the
agreement shall be interpreted to make the maximum disclaimer or
limitation permitted by the applicable state law. The invalidity or
unenforceability of any provision of this agreement shall not void the
remaining provisions.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
1.F.6. INDEMNITY - You agree to indemnify and hold the Foundation, the
trademark owner, any agent or employee of the Foundation, anyone
providing copies of Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works in
accordance with this agreement, and any volunteers associated with the
production, promotion and distribution of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
electronic works, harmless from all liability, costs and expenses,
including legal fees, that arise directly or indirectly from any of
the following which you do or cause to occur: (a) distribution of this
or any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, (b) alteration, modification, or
additions or deletions to any Project Gutenberg&#8482; work, and (c) any
Defect you cause.
</div>

<div style='display:block; font-size:1.1em; margin:1em 0; font-weight:bold'>
Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg&#8482;
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg&#8482;&#8217;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg&#8482; collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg&#8482; and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg&#8482; electronic works
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg&#8482; concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Project Gutenberg&#8482; eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>

<div style='display:block; margin:1em 0'>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.

This website includes information about Project Gutenberg&#8482;,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
